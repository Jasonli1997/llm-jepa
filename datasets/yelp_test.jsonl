Uhhh...If I'm craving a salad with ginger dressing, which I always am, (you do too. admit it) fried rice, steak, shrimp and white sauce (DUDE) then Kabuto is king of lunch options in my book. Always super clean and full of kindhearted staff. The parking lot is super difficult to get in and out of though. 51 traffic at lunch is a beast. Good luck getting stuck behind someone trying to cut across traffic at 12pm on a weekday. It's murder. This place would greatly benefit from another exit/entrance or a stoplight. Here's hoping....\\n\\nYou can't really shake a stick at balanced lunch when you can have soup or a salad, veggies, fried rice and a choice of a protein for under $10 and be back out the door and headed back to the office or meeting. Glad to see these guys have taken this into account. Though, you should know that the $10 offering mostly comes in the protein department. Some may require more steak or chicken, which can be sparse. \\n\\nService is always quick and friendly. They do a wonderful job of memorizing orders. Rarely has it come to pass that my order has been mal-delivered. Quick on refills and I love that they always offer a to-go beverage. \\\"Why, yes! I would love a diet coke to go! How thoughtful!\\\" Pretty much always my thought process. \\n\\nThis place also does full dinner options and has sushi. Neither of which I have tried to date, but would happily oblige if the option was presented. \\n\\nThanks for the quick and entertaining lunch/service, Kabuto!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mediocre"}]}

The front desk was very friendly, let us check in a little bit early. And took care of anything we needed but let me tell you I've done Las Vegas more than a few times, so my group didn't need much. Housekeeping happens like after a few days so we checked in Tuesday and got our rooms cleaned on Friday/Saturday. In addition to cleaning our rooms, we received plenty of towels, blankets, pillows on demand.\\n\\nThe room was decent. It's not the Ritz Carlton by no means. My GF & I shared the single jr suite room. It had a decent size closet, dresser, & bathroom. The bathroom was cool, nothing special. The shower did have a nice size bathtub so you could take a relaxing bath. Our toilet clogged up but they sent someone right up and it was good for the rest of the week. The bed was pretty comfortable, pillows and blankets better than a cheap motel. The AC worked awesome and kept both of the rooms very cool. It was nice to have a mini kitchen with a fridge for our stuff and a sink. We also had cups and plates. I was pretty pleased with the room in general.\\n\\nOur friends shared the adjointed room next door. It had almost a full kitchen with oven and microwave, a dining table plus sofa sleeper. The balcony patio was cool but it faced the road instead of the pool. The full size fridge came in handy for supplies and food. Oh yeah, washer and dryer plus complimentary laundry soap! We all did some laundry!\\n\\nThe pool was NOT very clean. The hot tub had a whole crap load of leaves in there. I wasn't impressed with the pool but the 24 hours was nice. We didn't really take advantage of it though.\\n\\nThe exercise room was decent. It had a stationary bike, treadmill and stairmaster (I think). It also had a full body work out machine that you could do all the basic exercises with weights. They do stock towels there for you and your sweat which was nice.\\n\\nHonestly since I had a rental car, the distance from the strip was just fine. If I wanted to do Las Vegas on the strip with no rental car, I wouldn't stay here. My friends used the shuttle and you're not getting anywhere fast on that thing. In addition it takes a while to get from point A to point B. \\n\\nAll in all I would rate this place at around 3.5 stars. It's better than an average motel and it's pretty cheap and decent!

The restaurant is equally small but colorful with just a handful of two- and four-top tables, and maybe ten seats facing a high counter along the window. There are veggies and animals painted all over the walls, with fun metal corrugated ceiling tiles. It's a loud, lively space, and gets a bit hectic when it's crowded. The menu has a healthy and unhealthy side, both filled with quite a number of items for breakfast, lunch or dinner. On the healthy side you will see juices, snacks, gluten-free pizzas and sandwiches. On the unhealthy side, or happy side as they call it, you have choices of shakes, waffles, snacks, sandwiches, and more. There seems to be plenty of options for whatever you're looking for, and I'll certainly have to stop back in to try some more.\\n\\nSo as usual I came for one thing, and in this case it's their Cheeseburger Benedict: 1/2lb angus burger with lettuce, tomato, pickles, cheddar, avocado, red onion, fried egg and SF sauce. What came out looked great, but was kind of like the Rollin' Smoke burger I ate a few weeks ago; too damn large to properly enjoy. There's something to say of the spectacle, but the oversized assembly makes for a slightly inedible burger. The moment I picked it up and gave it a squeeze I could tell the bun might be a bit dry. The patty was sticking out from the edges of the bun so I was able to sample it on its own; it was of good quality and cooked well. The bun was indeed a bit too dry, and on first bite a bit too thick as well, but the burger quickly got messy so I saw the need for something with a bit more substance. The egg had good flavor but got a bit lost in everything, there was tons of cheese that had good flavor, although some of it still wasn't melted by the time it got to my table. The lettuce was prominent and proportionally just enough, and the pickles were also good. I knew the avocado was there because a few slices fell out, but I couldn't taste it within the burger with all those other flavors mixed in. If this burger was simplified and you could properly sample some of the intended flavors it could be really great, but there is just far too much going on to enjoy this. Does any burger really need a fried egg, onion, pickles, avocado AND a sauce? I guess many people would argue that this is what a burger is all about, but for me it's a bit much. Oh and as for that sauce, I don't even know what it tasted like, and for me that's the problem.\\n\\nThe truffle fries on the other hand were really good; almost all of them were cooked well and they were very flavorful. I found myself eating them well after my giant burger was done. Again, I feel like I have to defend myself with my slight disappointment; a massive burger is a great thing, but when you add too many toppings they start to cancel each other out. Maybe the solution is choosing only one or two of their offered toppings, which could provide a slightly simplified and very flavorful burger. For $10.50 with fries this really isn't a bad deal, I just found it to be a few too many items piled together. Still, the menu looks great, and all the food looks to be of very good quality, so I'll surely be back to try other items soon."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mediocre"}]}

However, the customer service here runs the gamut from distracted to disinterested to downright rude. \\n\\nI stop in maybe twice a month.  Fromagination carries a plethora of hard-to-find artisanal and gourmet food items.  The charcuterie offerings are spare, which was a bit of a letdown, but they do boast a decent variety of beautifully displayed and properly packaged cheese (though it's not as extensive as I'd expect--despite Fromagination's artful arranging I'd venture a guess that Whole Foods' selection is nearly equivalent and less pricey). I just can't handle the counter staff.  I think it mainly stems from a time this winter where a gentleman was asking to taste a few cheeses-- he was putting together a cheese platter, he said, and wasn't quite sure where to start.  After he asked to taste a few cheeses, and was peering into the case, the woman behind the counter sighed loudly, put a hand on her hip, and said \\\"Are you actually going to buy some cheese, or are you just trying to get free samples?\\\" The man was flabbergasted (as were all of us in the store) and stammered, \\\"Ma'am, I'm having a dinner party for some of my professors, and I really wanted to impress them with a nice cheese plate.  But I guess I'll take my business elsewhere.\\\" Clearly embarrassed, he turned and walked out.  \\n\\nThat's the most extreme example I've witnessed (though on separate occasions I've heard people say \\\"I have money to spend here...\\\" as they stood, stymied by the lack of attention) but it exemplifies the general vibe pretty well.  With the marked exception of one kind older man who is patient and helpful when I'm there, the cheesemongers at Fromagination seem aloof and haughty.  I often dread going in even if I need something that I can only get there, because I feel very pressured to purchase lest they think I'm merely sampling the wares.  Also, I generally have a good idea of what I want to buy-- but sometimes they'll steer me away from it! \\\"This is a very hard cheese.  Are you sure that's what you want?\\\" Yes. I know that Vintage Van Gogh cheese basically crumbles to the touch.  I also know that its nutty, caramel flavor is exactly what I want.  Thanks!  \\n\\nI will keep going to Fromagination, especially because the shop takes great pains to promote local/regional cheese makers, but I hope they consider the constructive criticism and perhaps start having fun with the idea of selling cheese."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mediocre"}]}

Too bad all of them were about 12 pounds or larger, or else we'd have bought one to try, and I'd have one more thing to review here...\\n\\nThe reason I wanted to post something about my Aldi visit was to say that chocolate lovers must, if you haven't already, try a few of the European chocolates sold here!  You may find them among one of the first crates to your left as you enter the store and proceed forward.  Two brands we tried were Choceur [dark choc, milk choc, and milk choc w/ almonds (those w/ a hazelnut allergy would best stay away from the almond bar-- it contains hazelnut paste)] and Moser Roth (chili dark choc).  While the Choceur milk chocolate and almond bar was delicious (not too sweet!), I did feel the room spin as soon as I had a bite (I'm able to eat toasted hazelnuts w/out problems, but hazelnut spreads and chocolate-covered hazelnuts do cause allergy symptoms).  I'm savoring a few pieces of the dark chocolate variety as I type this... Mmm, and it's so melt-in-your-mouth creamy-dreamy!  If you're a bit daring when it comes to mixing chocolate and peppers, then you may like Moser Roth's Chili bar.  I didn't find it as spicy as my baby sis did, but then again, she doesn't really like spicy dishes (she orders a \\\"1\\\" when at a Thai restaurant that serves dishes ranging a mild 1 to an inferno 5), but the flavors harkened to the times when I tried Mexican hot cocoa and churros made w/ Ibarra chocolate....\\n\\nMy older sister's MIL LOVES the brownie mixes here!  I can't review it, as it contains corn products; However, the aromas that wafted throughout the house while it baked sure smelled delightful!  (The beautiful cracked surface of the brownies also teased me until I finally had to turn away before I gave in.  LOL)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mediocre"}]}

The manager, I\\u00f1igo, even stopped by to chat with K'ayum (age 8) and watched him do his latest magic trick.  We ordered queso fundido with chorizo.

The place is huge to begin with so you have a tough time seeing the stage shows if you are seated in one of the tables along the back wall. It was completely packed as well. The dancers didn't have much personality and were over the top fake. \\n\\nFirst off, my wife and I purchased a couples package. They advertised that they catered to couples and when I called to schedule the limo, the girl on the phone suggested getting the prepaid package. We got there and were treated like scum because we prepaid. After reading some of the other reviews this now makes sense because they didn't have my credit card to charge a bunch of stuff to. We were taken to a crappy table and stuffed in where it was hard for the dancers to come over to us and tough to get out.\\n\\nWe were supposed to get $140 in drinks once we got there as part of the package. The waitress was horrible and came by maybe once every hour. We ended up getting 3 beers each the entire time we were there. Those were some really expensive beers I guess. \\n\\nThe dancers were really cold to us until my wife would go to the bathroom. Then they would come and bug me for a dance. Only one girl was nice to her the entire time we were there. That is the only good part of our entire time at this place. Otherwise, we actually had to approach several girls ourselves and ask them for dances. In my opinion this place is NOT couples friendly at all. \\n\\nWe got the limo to pick us up and take us there but once you get there you have to find your own way back. There are taxis out front but definitely plan on paying to get back to the strip at the end of the night. \\n\\nMy opinion is that if you are a 21 year old college kid and want to see some boobs and don't mind being packed into a place that resembles a rave club, this is your venue. If you have any maturity level at all and want to be treated with any decency then you might as well just go to any of the big Vegas shows. They are all topless and the alcohol is cheaper. \\n\\nWe tried The Palomino Club the next night and had a much better time. We were treated with respect, the venue is fully nude with alcohol, the women were more attractive and much nicer to us, we were never without a drink and they gave us a ride back to our hotel at the end of the night.

It was $24.99 for brunch.  The wait was long but the food was ok.  I like from a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 6, compared to the Wynn which I give a 9.  A lot of their food lacked flavor.  The line was long and the dessert bar SUCKED!  I love dessert, and it is a 3 compared to the Wynn which i give a 10.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Taste wise, I did not care for it.  Our waitress was great, she was very busy, but she tried to keep up with our needs especially the mimosa refills, which I guess was the only good thing about the buffet because it was included and non stop refills.  I would have given this place a 3 star except for the situation that happened while we were waiting for a table.  Originally we had 4 people for the buffet, and a few of our friends joined us and it turned into 9.  Which after waiting for an hour and a half in line, we didn't want to wait for a larger table.  There was a large group in front of us maybe about 20 before we got there and they waited for a while for a table.  So we decided that we were going to split into 2 groups since we weren't going to leave the restaurant at the same time anyways.  So we told our waitress that we wanted to go from 9 people into 2 groups of 4 and 5.  Well, when we told her that she got mad, but we weren't even next in line for a table.  We were maybe about 10 people behind being next.  So we did ask if we can get seated near each other if possible but when we told her, Marta the hostess got all mad at us and started giving us dirty looks.  We were then seated and a few minutes later my friends that met us up there were seated as well, they were seated on the opposite side of the restaurant where there was another table that was vacant the whole entire time they were there even before they were seated.  So Marta could have seated us together but she didn't and while we were eating the whole time she kept giving us dirty looks.  We later realized that if it was a party of 8 people or more the gratuity charge is 18%.  So we were given bad service with dirty looks because our hostess wasn't going to get the 18% gratuity charge.  I have been to Rio and the Wynn's buffet, and never at any of the other two buffets had we had bad service due to a gratuity charge.  Like I said you get what you pay for.  And another thing that I almost forgot to mention if you are looking for the omelet station, look at the dessert bar, because it's not near where the savory food is, but if you are looking for the crepe bar, it is next to where the savory food are and oh don't get banana's for your crepe, because they are brown and mushy."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Bad"}]}

She was very sweet during the process, however when she was finished there was absolutely no difference at all!!! I am naturally a brunette and have always liked to have natural-looking golden blonde highlights. Kasondra gave me no blonde color and my highlights looked brassy and unnatural. On top of that I had asked for a trim of my layers and it literally looked like someone had taken a butcher knife to my hair. It was completely uneven! I went into work the next day and my boss felt so bad for me she allowed me to take 3 hours off to go get my hair fixed!\\n\\nEnter Tawni-the owner of the salon. I called in a panic needing to get my hair fixed as I was leaving town on vacation. The salon offered to put me with Kasondra again but, needless to say, I was not excited about that option.

Tawni was also so interactive and engaging the whole time I was in her chair. Her assistant Sonni even gave the most wonderful scalp massage! Since then I will only see Tawni and trust her with my hair! One thing I will say is since she is the owner of the salon and very busy you are often there for a long time with other stylists washing your hair and blowdrying/styling you.\\n\\nI gave this review 4 stars because the salon is so quaint, the staff is lovely, and Tawni is awesome!

The line? to get into the club looked absolutely ridiculous. There was no order here. Thankfully, we met up with our hook (who was also helping out 30 other people). We made our own separate line that snaked through the \\\"mega line\\\". \\n\\nAs our line got closer to the door, all the guys from all the groups were stopped, so all of the girls from our groups could go in.

I thought for a little bit that we were going to get swindled, but luckily we got inside. For free. The big line had barely moved.\\n\\nOnce inside, our girls were given 2 free drink tickets and they in turn gave one of their tickets to the guys. However, we were denied at the bar from using the tickets that were for females only apparently. So we gave the tickets back to the girls who got the drinks for us... I couldn't tell if we were outsmarting them or if they were dumber than a sack of rocks. Once I started paying for drinks, the bartenders were on point and I never waited more than 3 minutes to get a drink. I cant say the same for places like Marquee.\\n\\nThe layout of the club is basically an average size dance floor and a couple bar areas. There is no outside, no craps table, no places to really take a break from dancing.\\n\\nMeanwhile, they never close off the dance floor, they just let people pile in there like a bunch of sardines. They compound this issue by having ASSHOLE bouncers guard the bottle service tables that lie on the inside of the dancefloor. When I say guard, I mean no holding back. I was literally shoved in the back by a bouncer with a giant stupid Mohawk 3 or 4 times, forcing other people to spill their drinks on me as we collided. This guy was seriously on another level when it comes to bouncers. He was pushing another guy much larger than himself, and he would have gotten his shit rocked if that guy had lost his cool. I may have left a bootprint myself if that had happened.\\n\\nThe music was top 40 dance remixes with house drops. It was predictable, but still fun out on the dance floor. They also opened up a 2nd, smaller room that was playing hip-hop. The dance floor was much less packed.\\n\\nOverall this place was a good fun time, but had the potential of being an absolutely horrible night. I can only see myself going again if I can get in for free again.\\n\\nHope this was helpful."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mediocre"}]}

They finally came back days later & did some of the items that were not done, but after being in the new apartment for a couple months there are STILL several items that still need attention in the apartment - things that were never completed when she moved in. On top of all that, she then started receiving past due notices. She had spoken with the office manager when she first received the notice. The manager said it was for a cleaning deposit on the old apartment... she said since there had been such inconveniences with the whole transition and items still not being properly fixed in the new apartment that she would have that fee waived. Since that conversation 2 additional notices were sent out & the price has now tripled. She pays rent on time every month, she is a good tenant & has been really patient, but is now more than a little frustrated.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Determine whether the comment is positive or negative"}, {"role": "user", "content": "We went for an early Saturday night dinner, drawn in by new fine dining in the area (which is limited) and the promise of local farm to table style. We are huge fans of many local farm efforts, which can be sampled at the Common Ground Co-op and the Market at the Square on Saturdays at Lincoln Square Mall -- and now, Big Grove Tavern.\\n\\nFirst, the food, from a foodie perspective: Fresh product, well selected and well cared for. The flavors of the natural food are highlighted. The preparation is often minimally invasive. The technique is classic French. The flavor profile is quiet. \\n\\nMy partner and I both wished for something a touch bolder. For example, the deviled eggs, a pre-starter, have yolks mixed with peas. We would suggest adding an acid note, perhaps a pickle. \\n\\nIt was nice that they brought out flavored popcorn as a freebie with our drinks -- a feature at BGT. The flavor of the night was white truffle oil -- and you could taste the oil. That was a real win.\\n\\nFor starters, my partner had the chili and cornbread, and I had the chicken liver pate with pickled onions and stewed rhubarb. I think mine was better -- really delicious, with rich, deeply flavorful pate contrasted against the rhubarb, which gave the bite the sweet and sour it needed to cut through. The farmstyle, whole grain bread had a wonderful crunch. The cornbread was a bit too refined -- it needed  more crust and less cake, more corn flavor and less cafe baked-good sweetness. The chili was savory, but mild--no real taste of chilis.\\n\\nThe entree and dessert courses were both very good, especially dessert. My partner had the short ribs, which were beautifully medium rare -- not a hint over or under. I had the roast chicken with dumplings, which was amazingly good. Crisp skin, moist and flavorful meat, with a delicious herb broth under. Three dumplings that tasted like a delicate stuffing and had a satisfying bite. Slices of asparagus that also had a nice bite and a lovely green flavor still -- not at all cooked out. The portions seemed just right -- not too much and not too little.\\n\\nFor dessert, my partner had the rhubarb crisp and i had the chocolate pot de creme. Both were really superb: refined, flavorful, rich, balanced. Nothing fussy -- just satisfaction in every bite, with very good coffee on the side (they use a medium blend from the Columbia Street Roastery -- a fine choice).\\n\\nThe food is not bold. Or experimental. Or imaginative. But it is good, very good -- much better, I thought, in terms of technique than Carmon's Bistro.\\n\\nIt's clear from the limited but well selected menu that the chef behind it is attempting to appeal to middlebrow Midwestern tastes, but doing it in such a quality way that I found it kind rather than condescending. People who don't necessarily like a chi-chi dining experience will enjoy the food, and those who do like fine dining will think it is predictable in its selections but well done nonetheless.\\n\\nSecond, the decor and atmosphere: I generally like the blend of industrial and contemporary tavern that the interior designer seems to have been going for, although the dark colors dominate a little too much, despite the effort to add bits of fun in the lighting options. \\n\\nBGT has a chic, young vibe -- somewhere between casual and serious. Dark gray walls with a black drop tile ceiling, black wire-cage pendant lamps with industrial bulbs of different shapes (reminds me of the recent Restoration Hardware line), bleached branch chandeliers over the bar area, outdoor party-lights with clear exposed globe bulbs interlaced with raw blond planks (one off note: the planks have lumber-yard stamps, which may be a bit too low-end for what they were going for),  fairly inexpensive light-wood grain tables and nicely selected dark chairs--if a bit flimsy--and booth upholstery. I hope that over time BGT will invest in some better art pieces, and ones that bring more interest and warmth to the interior. There's seating outside too, if you're a smoker or don't mind getting it second hand.\\n\\nThird, cost: Yes, yes, it's on the expensive side. BGT is fine dining, not family dining. I won't be eating here every night either. Of course, any diner can make the meal more affordable by just sticking with an entree, rather than getting the whole shebang -- I'd guess for dinner that this would run you $20-25 tops. But if you have a deeper pocket that night, the whole shebang here could run you $100 with tip for two -- and you still won't feel cheated. The value is here, given the quality of experience.\\n\\nFourth, service: BGT has a young, eager service staff. They took good care of us, and every other table I could see. From beginning to end, we enjoyed our time here."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good"}]}

Last Sunday I wanted Chinese food and J&K says they deliver. I wanted to try a new dish I read a few reviews and suggestions and from other Yelpers. Called them up at 4 PM ordered Salt & Pepper chicken and Gang Pang Beef for delivery. Well the person on the phone says it's a $25 minimum order for delivery and says it will take 45 minutes or more to deliver to my house even though I'm only 3 miles away. I really didn't feel like driving anywhere hence the whole reason for calling the restaurant in the 1st place. The manager states if I pick it up it will be ready in 10 minutes, this seemed reasonable, I agreed. I wait at the house for a few minutes and make 1 stop at CVS before going into J&K about 15 mins later and walk in to the front desk expecting my order to be ready, Nope. They try giving me somebody's else's order I tell them that's not what I ordered they ask for my phone # then tell me it's not ready. So I have to sit and wait another 10 minutes, the place is not busy it's a Sunday afternoon around 4:30. I finally get my order 20 minutes later than originally stated and go home. First off I've never had either entr\\u00e9e before and didn't know what to expect but judging from appearance alone the Gang Pang Beef, it kind of grossed me out and my roommate even commented on the appearance. It seriously looked a bunch of dirty peckers covered in brown sauce. Its heavily breaded beef and suppose to be spicy with 2 peppers indicating so on the menu. Not spicy what so ever and so heavily breaded I wouldn't of known I was eating beef. As far as the Salt & Pepper chicken, all I can say is hold the Salt. That's all I could taste is salt and I know the name has salt in it but that can't be right. Unfortunately I didn't enjoy either entr\\u00e9e and didn't finish them.

The spectacle takes months to plan, w/ the plans being drawn up in Montreal and sent to Singapore, where the lanterns are fabricated.  The completed lanterns are sent back to Montreal, where they are assembled, wired and put in place.  The theme of this year's display is the reign of the first Emperor, Qin Shi Huangdi and his cavalry, but there are also mythical, magical creatures like dragons amid the foliage.  Lanterns are set up throughout the Chinese Garden, in the ponds and amongst the plants.  The Botanical Garden stays open later, until 9PM, for the occasion and I would imagine the lanterns are even more impressive after dark than they were in the daylight.  There are bilingual signs explaining the significance of the display and the items in it.  The Garden itself is lovely and tranquil w/o the lanterns, w/ stone \\\"windows\\\" set in the walls looking out of the garden and walkways paved in intricate patterns of pebbles and stones.

The pasta was cooked perfectly and the savory filling had a creamy texture that was bursting with flavor. It was like the perfect marriage of poultry and red meat flavor. Definitely unforgettable!

Still, I can't continue to patronize a company that blames the consumer first and then researches the problem to find it was their fault.

PLEASE just get this. Housemade yogurt and granola and it was divine. Great, fresh fruit throughout.\\n--Chicken-apple sausage! Just a tad sweet and big on taste. \\n\\nI prefer Thomas Keller's Bouchon over at the Venetian-- more selection, not as overpriced, and just overall better, in my opinion. If you're at the Mandarin Oriental, though, then this is your best (and only?) bet for a breakfast and/or early lunch."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mediocre"}]}

We were not offered this service and when I called to inquire I was treated as if I was making it up! There was something a little disappointing about dropping 2500 on dinner and having to walk 200 yards through a smoky casino to get to a cab.

Not one memorable in a good way course. Plating was unattractive at best. There were inedible garnishes- costume jewelry and ribbons. And they taped down the bowls to the serving trays with scotch tape. And to top it off, the cheese cart is not included in the degustation menu! Minus two stars for food. \\n\\nKicker- up most of the night with stomach issues. If my phone call re: limo service was any indication, my call to inform the restaurant of this will not go well. \\n\\nOnly bright spot was the $595/person wine pairing.

My night started with the checking of ID's and mockery of my age using huge, and seemingly permanent black  x's on my wrists. I'm used to having everything poked, prodded, and searched through but here as long as I paid, I was in. I could have taken a butcher knife inside of the venue and no one would have known. I'm not for invasion of privacy but I definitely want a little bit of security when surrounded by havock-causing stereotypes. The standing area was separated between 21+ and the less fortunate so I took my usual place next to the 16 year olds taking phone videos of the concert and texting their friends. \\nThe show was okay. I'm honestly don't know anything about sound systems and such being someone who has enjoyed the acoustics of a garage show before. So there wasn't anything noticeably bad...but I wasn't particularly impressed with much either. \\nAt the end of the show I started feeling really nauseated. It was super hot inside, the sweaty, shirtless were spinning and kicking in my direction, and my inability to LEAVE to get some air induced a feeling to throw up all over myself. Thankfully I didn't but I had to dive out at the last minute, not being able to bear the smell of greasy humans and what I deducted to be every one in the entire place to be taking a dump all at once. \\nFunny enough, I was told later by my boyfriend that there were two staff members desperately trying to push back an overflowing toilet in the bar section. Well...that explains that. \\nI DO like this place because it's dingy, small, and authentic. You feel like you're watching a show on a more personal level which makes a huge difference when watching a live performance. I also really appreciate the bands that they book.

And once again, the Valley's populace has NOT let me down:  apparently, only ex-cons who suffered with prison food and people who've lost their sense of taste (both physical and mental) give 4 and 5 stars on Yelp to ANYTHING.\\n\\nFirst, let me say, that this restaurant's employees couldn't do more to make your dining experience a pleasant one:  they're friendly, very attentive and respond quickly to any request you could throw at them.  \\n\\nI haven't seen many Indian restaurants, which serve buffets at night, so I was curious to see how this place stacked up against other Indian places I've been to.  The decor is ... interesting.  From the ground level to about 7 feet up, the decor is homey and reminds you of Cheers-gone-Diner.  Above 7 feet, the decor can best be described as \\\"condemned factory\\\".  But okay ... while decor is important in enjoying your meal, it's not necessarily a deal breaker ... if the food makes up for it.  Sadly, this is not the case.  While I give the restaurant overall two stars, I would specifically rate the food as  \\\"two-flushes\\\"  (figure it out, if you dare!).  I'm sorry, but this just happens to be one of those places that support my argument against low-flow toilets.  It's not that the food looks unappetizing; it's just that, well, it IS:  oversalted food; dry tandoori chicken; thin-sauce chicken tikki masala (and that was the BEST dish).  The na'an was okay ... actually, I liked it because it's thick; my other half likes the na'an thin and crispy.  Funny enough, the place was absolutely packed  (no doubt only with people who could prove they usually give at least 4 stars on their Yelp reviews).  \\n\\nI really wanted to give this place a stellar review, not the least, because its employees are top notch.

The \\\"ambience\\\", if one can use that term here, was part taco joint, part Mexican food store, and part Mexico City bus station replete with a tv showing telenovelas. We were dying for tequila or at least a nice cerveza, but alas, no liquor licence. However, they do have some \\\"drink if you dare\\\" Mexican sodas, which contain twice the legal limit of sugar and food coloring of normal soda (which I generally don't drink anyway, unless it's mixed with something). Don't expect too much in any regard here. They do tacos, fairly well, and that's what I'd recommend ordering here, although something possessed me to order the tamales too (more on that in a sec). We started off with guacamole. Having lived a good 10 years in Texas, and traveled a lot to Mexico for work, it was, well, really odd. They mix iceberg lettuce and tomato in with the avocado, and there's nary a hint of garlic or lime. The result is a bit gloopy and fairly unpleasant, especially if you're expecting a beautifully dense unctuous avocado forward, garlic, lime, salt, and cilantro based dip. Oh well. The tortilla chips though, which seemed homemade, were light and crisp, and we even bought a bag to take home. The salsas were equally good, with the tomato based one being the standout. The tomato salsa was served warm, and had bay leaf and celery in it - a flavor combo I've never had in Mexico, but one which really worked. We also bought some salsa to take home. We had beef tacos and tacos al pastor. The beef tacos were pretty good, but too much char on the meat, and the overall flavor was bland. The tacos al pastor were just as they should have been though, nicely cooked meat and great tang from the pineapple. Big marks also for serving everything with soft corn tortillas. The tamales though were pretty bad. I am a big tamale fan. These were mealy and dry, and the filling was cloyingly sweet and unpleasant. This place does tacos, and they do them pretty well. I'd come back for the tacos al pastor and chips and salsa, and the telenovelas of course. Hasta pronto."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mediocre"}]}

From the moment we arrived, until we left, our service was simply HORRIBLE. First, at the hostess stand the hostess stood glaring at her computer screen as we stood waiting to be acknowledged. Never did acknowledge us, so we turned around and went to the bar. 2 cocktails (a beer and a wine) 17 bucks, gave the older man bartender a 20 and he NEVER CAME BACK WITH OUR CHANGE!

And if he \\\"forgot\\\" even worse, he shouldn't be working at such a restaurant as the Golden Steer.  So we went back to the stand and the \\\"harried\\\" hostess was able to accommodate our reservation, clueless as to our earlier \\\"encounter\\\".  The food service was slow, wreck-less (no refills of anything: water, bread, butter, coffee, or up-sell cocktails!), and the removal of dirty plates never happened.

I'm kind of jaded as I've stayed in many 4/5 star rooms in Vegas (mandalay, venetian, caesars,etc) so I didn't find that this one was all that exciting or spectacular. It was however very nice and on par with a 5 star hotel.\\n\\nRestaurants/Shopping (5): Incredible, tons of great restaurants and lots of great shopping. Shops are open until 11! however, not any good casual options.\\n\\nPool (3): Ok so as a word of warning.. the pool at palazzo doesn't get sun until 1 PM!!! Ok so you're thinking you might be sleeping till 1 Pm anyways, but good luck getting a chair at that point without paying the pool guys a fat tip. Also, no food served pool side! You have to get up and get your food (I'm a prima donna, I know) and the food isn't that good and WAY overpriced. Also drink service was lacking.. I should have moved over to the Venetian side I guess?\\n\\nNightlife Gaming (3): High limits ($15) for craps.. no surprise there. Lavo was just ok, but I'd like to explore the jazz bar next time. 40/40 sucks. I did however enjoy the happy hour at the cheesy \\\"del toro\\\" in the basement. $6 drinks ,  I guess that's cheap? At least it had a nice strip view. Oh the sportsbook sucks too.. it's just a window near 40/40. boo\\n\\nEase of navigation (5): So this is important to me in Vegas.  I hate walking 30 minutes to my room, or having trouble finding craps,  restaurants, etc. This place is EASY. 1 tower of elevators, everything is well situated. Pool right off the elevators. That aspect is very nice.\\n\\nOverall a great place to stay, but with so many other great places to stay in Vegas I'd save this one for when you get a great offer in the mail.

It is \\\"New Mexican.\\\"  So if you're expecting whatever your idea of Mexican food is, you'll be confused and disappointed.  No soft tacos, no fish tacos, no big piles of tomato and lettuce with a side of sour cream.  Even the chips and salsa are different--the chips are thicker and crunchier, and the salsa is thin.  And there is no *mild* salsa.  \\n\\nI do not recommend this place for vegetarians,  nor is it for folks who don't like spicy food.  I also do not recommend their margaritas, unless you're okay with paying 10 bucks for a weak, too-sweet drink--to be fair, I like my margaritas the real, old-school way: tequila, triple sec, lime juice.  That's it.   But beer lovers should find something they'll like.\\n\\nIf you're smart, you'll steer clear of the pedestrian fare on the a la cart and combo menus and order from the \\\"chef's specials\\\" section.  I highly recommend the chile relleno with adovada and the chile plate with machaca.  Of course, you can customize several of the dishes by selecting whichever meat you want--chicken, adovada, machaca, etc. The only non-spicy option here is the carnitas, which I never order because I love the adovada too much to pass up on it.\\n\\nThe plates come with beans (very good) and rice (okay), and the servings are huge. The tortillas served on the side are thick, chewy and the perfect vehicle for sopping up all the spicy, gooey goodness on your plate.  I always end up needing a to-go box, which I invariably send home with my partner--one \\\"cheat\\\" a week is plenty, thanks!\\n\\nThe servers have always been friendly on my visits.  Last night, we had a very sweet young man who was as attentive as we would want.  The kitchen and the bar can be slow, though.  So don't expect to get in and out quickly.  The only thing that I totally disapprove of is the way the bill is sometimes presented.  Depending on how busy they are, sometimes the waiter brings you an iPad sort of device, and then stands there while you sign your bill.  I don't have an issue with going digital.  My problem is that the screen basically demands that you select from one of three pre-set tip amounts--I think it's 18, 20 and 22%.  I find that incredibly tacky, presumptuous and very awkward, since the server is standing there, waiting for you to finish with the device. \\n\\nSo I hope that the owners of this location are listening: Some of your guests may not know how to calculate a tip, but please don't insult those of us who do.  Do not impose upon our judgement of the service.  If you're *really* worried about your servers being screwed over by angry/cheap customers, make sure your employees do their jobs well, and/or pay them better.

Vogue Bistro and Bar, located in Marley Park at 15411 W. Waddell Rd. in Surprise is pleased to bring Cordon Bleu Culinary School trained Chef Aurore de Beauduy, most recently the former Chef at the Silverleaf Country Club located in DC Ranch in Scottsdale, to create contemporary American cuisine with a French bistro influence.  Now you can fulfill those gourmet desires Tuesday through Saturday,11:00 AM - Midnight or at Sunday Brunch from 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM. They are closed Mondays. \\n The ambiance is contemporary upscale with a crisp clean black and white d\\u00e9cor. Located in the Bashas Shopping center on the far west end of the center, it's not at all what you would expect for a neighborhood bistro in Surprise. They have brought class to the area, with style and service you would expect in the finest cities of the world. But then many of the residents in Surprise and Sun City are world travelers who will return frequently for the more sophisticated dining experience near home. \\n Our server, a delightful young lady, recommended a bottle of wine, Barro Rose Pinot Grigio from Italy (www.bacchannalwines.com) glass $9/ bottle $32 from the extensive wine list. Most of their wines are imported. We were pleased with her suggestion and the opportunity to taste two of her recommendations.  \\n Vogue owner Roman Yasinsky suggested Frito Misto $4 the tempura-fried calamari, seasonal vegetables, ginger bits, with a light aioli dip. He brought us an extra spicy dip to try as well. The presentation is delightful with swirled crisps piled high. Both dips and the calamari were very nice.  \\nAdditional \\\"Starters\\\" on the menu include Bruschetta $3 with Chef Aurore's daily topping selection; Escargot $7 a delicate escargot sauteed in herb infused garlic butter and baked in a puff pastry; Smoked Salmon $9 luxurious house-smoked salmon, cr\\u00e8me fra\\u00eeche, pickled caperberries, red onion, artisan toast points. The smoked salmon is also available whole, for take out orders; Olives $7 house-marinated premium Mediterranean olives; Artisan Cuts $9 country-style p\\u00e2te, assorted artisan sausages, salami and cured meats, olives, toasted almonds, Dijon mustard and warm handcrafted bread; Skewer $7 a daily selection of skewer grilled savory meats or seafood served with local seasonal greens and shaved Parmesan; Cheese $7 fine artisan cheeses from the world's best producers. \\n Next chef sent us a delicious Burotta Cheese Caprese $8. The creamy cheese from Italy is a special appetizer/salad not on the menu, and a unique twist on the traditional Caprese. Fresh basil and tomato accented with an Italian balsamic and this heavenly cheese that melts in your mouth instantly, lighter and sweeter than a traditional mozzarella. It was very much a pleasant surprise to experience something new and so delicious. \\n The Vogue Salad $8 with frisee, arugula, gorgonzola blue cheese, dried cranberries, pecans, pumpkin seeds and bits of applewood-smoked bacon tossed in warm sherry vinaigrette can be a meal in itself when topped with steak $4, chicken $4 or fish $4. The flavors of each unique ingredient combine to a flavor explosion so wonderful and satisfying.  \\nIn addition to the wonderful list of basics on the menu everyday, Chef Aurore prepares specials and I was luck enough to experience her Duck seared breast confit paired with red cabbage in a fig emulsion $28. Tender and flavorful, the duck had a fig emulsion sauce that complemented the red cabbage perfectly. It was accompanied by a butternut squash souffl\\u00e9 that was more like a dessert with its naturally sweet light as air texture. \\n My dining companion enjoyed a Chilean Sea Bass $17 with endive and burotta cheese, basil and vinaigrette. Extremely light with a mild flavor, the bass is a good choice for warm summer dinners.   \\n Other entrees on the menu include Steak Frites $15, all natural, prime grade Black Angus onglet steak prepared \\\"medium rare\\\" with brandied peppercorn sauce and served with Vogue Fries; Roasted Chicken $15, half chicken slowly roasted to perfection in herb-garlic jus, and served with Yukon Gold potatoes and roasted carrots; Fish $15, daily seasonal fish served with roasted sweet potatoes, local greens and warm citrus. She'll also be doing daily specials like osso buco, daurade, foie gras, cassoulet and duck confit. \\n Under the category of \\\"Accessories\\\" you will find some unusual but exciting offerings. Vogue Fries $3 are incredible according to several sources. Crisp and delicious, they are a perfect accompaniment to any sandwich or entrees and are served with a savory dipping sauce. I can't wait to return to try the Sweet Potato Fries $3 described as luscious and healthy on the menu, but \\\"orgasmic\\\" by a fellow diner. Vanilla Butternut Squash $3 is local organic butternut squash with vanilla beans, and Georgia pecans caramelized in maple syrup. too long again azphm .com for more...

Because up until about a month ago, I called Chicago home for the last 20 or so years.\\n\\nPizza has three main ingredients- a crust, a sauce (typically a tomato-based sauce), and cheese (typically mozzarella).  Serving two out of the three does not mean you can still call it a pizza.  This is pass/fail, all or nothing, an you are not graded on a curve; there is no 'E' for effort.\\n\\nNow some will argue, but typically, 'Chicago-style' pizza has a thick crust and, in at least a couple of restaurants, the sauce and cheese layers are inverted, but the pizza HAS sauce (am I making my point here, or am I being too subtle?).\\n\\nDo yourself a favor, BJ.  Go to Chicago, and go to Gino's East, Pizzeria Uno, Due's, and Lou Malnotti's for a crash course in what 'Chicago-Style' pizza is, then come back here and fix this trainwreck of bread and cheese before you do any permament damage to the phrase 'Chicago-Style Pizza'; well, no more than you've already done.\\n\\nYour one saving grace is the beer you brew right on premises, otherwise this two-star review would be a one-star review, and I'd never have a reason to darken your doorstep, or subject anyone else to your bread with melted cheese on top.\\n\\nKeep up the good work on the beer, but fire the guy that came up with your pizza recipe and start over.

I'm guessing most of them didn't know what Cirque du Soleil is famous for, because Cirque du Soleil this show was not.\\n\\nCirque du Soleil is, first and foremost, a unique art form that provides jaw-dropping, unforgettable displays of physical human ability.  It's not just my opinion; their own website proclaims as much.  This incredible experience is what causes people to book pricey shows weeks in advance. \\n\\nBut there were almost none of the signature Cirque du Soleil acrobatics.  Instead there were lots and lots of interpretive dance moves, running around in elaborate costumes, nonsensical random artsy monologue and dialogue - and, oddly, grunting.  (At least three of us thought said grunting had an awkward racial tinge.)  As a result, the show felt less like Cirque and more like a live action re-enactment of the multi-media displays of Beatles' memorabilia that I'd seen recently, of all places, interspersed between gameplay in the video game Beatles Rock Band.\\n\\nThis version of \\\"Cirque du Soleil light\\\" seemed to answer the question I had going in: how does one maintain the Cirque identity without upstaging the legendary Beatles?  Apparently the producers answer was \\\"We won't.\\\"\\n\\nWhile costumes, interpretive dance, and general weirdness are indeed part of Cirque du Soleil's identity, I don't think they're the parts that people come to shows for.  And based on the applause I heard, it seemed like I wasn't the only one in the audience that felt this way.  Not once was applause instantaneous, the way it is when a crowd is wowed by a performance.  And, to my own disappointment for the dutiful and energetic performers, not once was the applause prolonged beyond that required by courtesy.  In an earlier life, I spent a lot of time onstage myself, and weak ovations like this are heartbreaking, especially when the disappointment is not the fault of the performer.\\n\\nYet as I left the theater, I overheard at least four patrons (all women) remark on how much they loved the show.  It was unclear to me if this was genuine awe at the overall experience, a rekindled infatuation with the Beatles, denied guilt at having just paid $132 to watch a big music video with some interpretive dancers, or something else.  To some extent, I understood those who enjoyed the show. The Beatles songs I adore most - 'While my Guitar Gently Weeps' and 'Hey Jude' among them - were the ones I remembered most fondly.  It suggested to me that those who thought they loved the show actually just loved the music.  The sound quality was impeccable, delivered through a massive custom audio setup including stereo in-seat speakers that made the Beatles' music come alive in a way even my higher end multi-speaker car stereo cannot.  When combined with the light show and special effects, it was often a better-than-average way to experience Beatles' recordings.\\n\\nBut the standard should be much higher than beating your car stereo.  To receive 5 stars, this show needs some changes: first, drop the \\\"Cirque du Soleil\\\" branding.  Second, advertise it as an interpretive dance plus Beatles music multimedia show.  Third, lower the price by 3x to be cheaper than the Beatles Rock Band video game.  Finally, have the surviving Beatles make cameos.\\n\\nI imagine none of this will happen anytime soon.  In the meantime, Beatles fans, rest assured that Cirque du Soleil did not upstage the Beatles.  And Cirque du Soleil fans, make sure you get tickets to a different Cirque show."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Bad"}]}

Such is the case here. The bldg sat empty for a bit and then... like magic the Tap Haus appears. But...so far it just sort of a space filler on Cave Creek Rd.\\n\\nWhile the people are nice enough it's a mixed bag of good and \\\"so so\\\" that is worth a trial period but doesn't bang me over the head to go back 2 or 3 times a week.  We've been there several times as it's not \\\"that bad\\\" and even on New Year's Eve wound up there. Service has been adequate and the last time even extra good. Consistency is still the key to any food operation and they're still trying.\\n\\nFor the most part, the food is a 6-7. The pasta with Chipotle sauce was good and spicy, and enough to take home for another meal but the chicken was rubbery and not the grilled fantasy you might have craved. Even the nice sauce wasn't enough to mask it's chewiness. The Prime Rib on NYE was decently spiced but even an end cut shouldn't be dry and still have marks where the jockey was beating it.\\n\\nThe batter they use for many things is good but... 8 medium to small onion rings for 6 bucks seemed a bit pricey for this \\\"Road House turn Tap Haus\\\". The one thing I keep hearing is that the music is good. They have a semi regular band and we might go and check that out this evening.\\n\\nThey've got a TV crowd as they have plenty to watch games and even Fox News, and you can sit around the lower bar with chairs which is good if you're prone to falling off high stools. Although from my experience so far, the drinks won't make you that tipsy. Let's face it, my drink of choice for 30 years+ has been the Long Island Ice Tea and I've had them from Hawaii to New York City, Vancouver to Miami. A good one should taste good not \\\"alcoholy\\\", but if after two you can still recite the Greek alphabet backwards in four seconds.....? It's probably not made with everything it should be and for the prices they get for that drink, you should get your money's worth. They do have a few decent wines and it's almost impossible to screw up a 7 & 7.\\n\\nIf you want beer beer beer... then you might like running the gauntlet of tap after tap. I'm not a beer person so other than a nice Corona on a hot day near a beach, i could care less but there's plenty of choices (nearly 100?) if you have a spare afternoon. You're sure to find something there that meets your  \\\"hops and barley\\\" expectations.\\n\\nSo.. for now.. 3 (really 2 1/2) stars, as the place has enough to bring in the people (maybe expectations are going down in CC) but we'll see how a couple more visits work out as this is convenient, small enough to be comfortable and with outdoor seating the lunch experience is relaxing.

(Beastie Boys, 1993)\\n10 days prior to Vegas, more than one person in our entourage attempted, valiantly and persistently to secure guest list accommodations, all to no avail, no recourse, no reply, no acknowledgment from Tao staff/management.

For over an hour prior to opening, we stood there (at the front of the line), as did countless others behind us, until a security/bouncer announced, \\\"regrettably\\\" of course, that they had over booked the guest lists and no general admission guests would get in.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Determine whether the comment is positive or negative"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay so the Forest Cafe is another place that has been reviewed a million times, but I feel I might still be able to offer some kind of valuable opinion.\\n\\nFirst off any faults I have with the Forest Cafe are nothing to do with it being vegetarian or vegan cafe. Again I feel like so many of the complaints about vegetarian places seem to confuse the fact that a place can be crap, like crap service and or crap cleanliness or crap food, regardless of it being vegetarian. In fact if the Forest Cafe did serve animal then its faults would be worse, for reasons we will come to. But for whats it's worth I don't agree with the fundamentalist view that  has been aired that animals were \\\"put on Earth\\\" to be eaten by humans (and I think most scientists would agree). I appreciate it's vegetarian/vegan stance, if nothing else its one more place vegetarians can go without having to worry about what's in their food. And as I have alluded to in other reviews, I'm sure meat eaters can still appreciate the occasional meat free dish in principal. Thus I don't find the fact that the Forest is vegetarian/vegan in itself to be a valid criticism (and suggesting vegetarianism is synonymous with hippyism is also ridiculous).\\n\\nANYWAY if you hadn't guessed from my ramblings already the Forest is a vegetarian cafe, as well as a meeting spot and venue. It's also volunteer run. As others have mentioned there is a sort of  \\\"hippy\\\", New Age aesthetic, although both those words are pretty meaningless.\\n\\nSo what are my problems with the Forest? My first is hygiene. Whilst the food can be just fine, and it's cheap too, the number of times I have been served dishes that have been lying out for too long, or the tables haven't been wiped in a long while. Can you see my point about meat now? The toilets have also been less than appealing on certain occasions in the past.\\n\\nThese are the sorts of things that bother me. I love that the Forest is volunteer run, I love that it's very liberal and relaxed about most, but those things need not be synonymous with disorganisation and uncleanliness. If anything that just furthers a stereotype that pervades some of these other reviews. My only other complaint is that whilst the Forest can be, as I have mentioned, a wonderfully open and easy going place where anyone can voice their opinion, it can contradictorily be a bit cliquey. I have found that some nights, during discussions and meetings, there are certain well known individuals who drown out and mock dissenting voices. It is the New Age eco dogmatic view in particular which seems to prevail without as much criticism as its deserves. Having said this, the Forest remains largely unhierarchal. And at how many other cafes can you even attend meeting and voice such opinions on how they are run in the first place?\\n\\nThe one thing I love and respect about the Forest is that you can go in and spend as much time as you like in there without buying a thing. How many places let you do that? I was recently thrown out of a pub after fifteen minutes of not buying anything while I was waiting for someone, and I was one of only three people in there! I like the Forest's stance on just being a place to \\\"hang\\\" if you so choose.\\n\\nSo whilst the Forest has so many great things going for it, there is room for improvement. Those anarchists and communitarians that use the Forest as a meeting place, should especially mind their own proclamations of unhierarchal social organisation, and its compatibility with order and effectiveness. The Forest needs to be a little more ordered and effective!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mediocre"}]}

It appears they kept the original inside dcor and the running water above and below creates a serene atmosphere.\\n\\nDescribing their food as 'sushi & gourmet fusion', you see a range of Asian techniques in their cooking.  \\n\\n* Boca Park Roll (Deep fried yellowtail topped with spicy tuna and scallions, served with eel sauce and spicy aioli.) - My favorite of those offered - eat it while it's hot!\\n\\n* Cucumber Wrap (A riceless sushi adventure with tuna, salmon, albacore, crab, avocado, and kaiware wrapped with cucumber.) - It's refreshing and light, and a nice contrast against other rolls with heavy sauces.\\n\\n* 9th Isle (Spicy tuna roll with spicy shrimp tempura, cucumber and kaiware sprouts served with sweet glazed unagi.) - Eel lovers and those scared off by the raw will enjoy this roll.\\n\\n* TNT (California roll topped with baked rock shrimp, shitake mushroom, and scallop with creamy aioli and sweet onion sauce.) - The mushroom topping dominates.\\n\\n* Baja Roll (California roll topped with marinated tuna, tomato, flying fish roe and green onion.) - One again, the toppings are coming off, but refreshing with the tomatoes.\\n\\n* Sea Stone Rainbow (A riceless sushi delight made with ahi tuna, salmon, snapper, and crab mix, rolled in soybean paper and served with balsamic-mango reduction.) - Reminds me of a spring roll and enjoyable for those watching their carb intake.\\n\\nDim sum offerings included the shrimp puff, which came with a mayo dipping sauce.  It was loaded with shrimp and yummy when eaten hot.  I also tried the steamed pork and vegetable purse, aka siu mai or pork dumpling.  These were standard with other dim sum restaurants.\\n\\nOne of my favorites was the Peanut Crusted Hibachi Satays (Grilled chicken thighs with cilantro, Fresno chiles, lemongrass, coconut, and soy peanut vinaigrette.).  It was full of flavor and the sauce was delicious!  The Beef Negimayaki (Tender and juicy teriyaki beef skewers with scallion kimchi filling, garlic and a light tomato relish.) was okay, the beef was rolled around the scallion and skewered, didn't taste as exception as it sounded.  The Stuffed Ahi Carpaccio (Thinly sliced ahi rolled around crab ceviche with jalapeno, salsa, baby greens and a ponzu glaze.) had a bit of caviar on top that made it decadent.\\n\\nA nice twist was the Haricot Vert & Asparagus Salad (Tomato concassee, frisee, chevre cheese and glazed walnuts with mustard vinaigrette.) which can be heavy with the goat cheese.  The nuts provide a sweet and crunchy texture to the softness of the cheese.\\n\\nOf the entre samples, my favorite was the Baked Miso Yaki Butterfish (Shiro miso, sake, mirin and ginger, served with braised coconut rice.).  The fish was soft and silky and the rice was like butter, so good!  The Grilled Black Angus Strip (Roasted garlic herb butter, served with cured tomatoes and roasted sweet potatoes.) wasn't as tender as I had hoped, but the potatoes were a lovely treat!  I heard great things about the Potato-Crusted Salmon (Served with stir-fried vegetables and a ginger lime butter sauce.), but it didn't live up to the excitement.  The potatoes were shoe-string and would come off in one piece and the salmon was standard.  The stir-fried veggies were julienne-cut, so the flavors were muddled together.  The Braised Tofu with Spicy Tomato Black Bean Sauce (Soft tofu coated in potato starch and fried in vegetable oil, braised in vegetable stock, soy and chili sauce and served with tomato concassee and black beans.) is typical of what I find at Chinese restaurants.  However, the tomato added a slight contrast that made it unique and possibly, a vegetarian's dream.  \\n\\nWith all the heavy eating, I was pleased with their dessert offerings.  They had two sweets to choose from - the Chocolate Zen and the White Chocolate Bliss.  I preferred the chocolate with its flourless, ganache-glazed dark chocolate cake over the white chocolate and coconut sponge cake.\\n\\nNot only did Sea Stone go all out on the food, they provided ample wine and sake tasting.  They had an extensive wine list, but their sake list is what kept me happy.  Not only do they offer traditional sake, but those who enjoy the sweeter side of life will enjoy Hana's fruit-based ones (Fuji Apple, Raspberry, and Lychee) and the Star Rabbit \\\"Blueberry Infused\\\" sparkling sake.  I'm a big fan of the sweet stuff, but the new discovery of the blueberry sparkling one was a fab find!\\n\\nOverall, Sea Stone is another Asian fusion restaurant in the Vegas scene.  Their market is different being off strip though and based in Boca Park.  They have a nice outdoor lounge area that would be great for after work dinner drinks and eats.  They offer some typical Asian fare and sushi, and some unique concoctions as well.  I'd be back to sample their other creative inventions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good"}]}

We were immediately brought chips and salsa.\\n\\nThe chips were very plain, but I kept eating them.  Our bowls of chips were never empty.  We only had one girl taking care of our whole table, but after a couple rounds of refilled sodas she seemed to be getting the hang of it.  We kept her pretty busy but she handled it well.  The kitchen however, had a little difficulty and there was about a 15 minute difference between the time the first person was served and the last person.  Oh well, we all got our food and it was all correct.\\n\\nI ordered the cheese enchilada and chimichanga (a mini one) combination plate.  The beans that came with the dish were sprinkled with cheese and very tasty.  They were surprisingly smooth and buttery, I'm not really picky about the beans.  The enchilada was a big fat disappointment to me because there were onions inside.  I thought it would just have cheese, because everywhere else I have gone and gotten a cheese enchilada it was just plain inside.  The chimichanga was actually really good to my picky palate.  The shredded beef was flavorful and juicy.  It was also covered in cheese, and that is always a good thing in book.  I could also do without the shredded lettuce on my plate.

Normally it goes for $2.79, so it's a great deal.  Another favorite is their Veggie Burrito, which is more flavorful than Chipotle and priced at the same $6.49.

They also have a good selection of beer.\\n\\nRubio's is not perfect and sometimes the fish can be dry.  But most of the time, it's really very good.  The folks who work here are also great.

You turn in your car, they deal with the insurance companies, they call you to pick up the car, you inspect it, pay your deductible, and go.\\n\\nThis time, they didn't do a bad job, per se, but they didn't live up to the expectations they had instilled in me from my previous experience with them.  \\n\\nFor example, the first time they worked on my vehicle, it had to be towed to their facility (as it was a melted glob of goo) and took about four weeks to repair.  This time, all I needed was a door repair and a bumper and quarter panel replaced and they quoted me 3.5 weeks.  \\n\\nNow, at this time, the other driver's insurance company wasn't contacting me or returning the calls my insurance adjustor was placing to them, so I was having to pay out-of-pocket for the car rental (the portion my carrier wouldn't cover), and of course, Enterprise had just jacked up their rates to take advantage of the snowbirds or spring training followers or whatever, so there was no way I was gonna pay for a rental car for nearly a month!  After some back and forth, it was revealed that the car would probably be ready within two weeks.\\n\\nFor the most part, I was satisfied with the work they did on my vehicle.  However, where they had repaired my door (instead of replacing it), I noticed there was a gap that was disproportionate to the gap on the other side of the SUV.  I was probably being nitpicky, but I noticed it, and I didn't appreciate the employee telling me, rather condescendingly, that they had no idea what I was talking about.  I would rather they have said, \\\"Yes, Ms. *insert name here*, I see what you're talking about, but in cases where car doors are repaired and not replaced, our technicians cannot always guarantee symmetry...\\\" or something along those lines.  I'd be more accomadating if I wasn't spoken to like I was an idiot.  \\n\\nAlso, upon inspecting the vehicle, I noticed pitting in the paint job.  The employee was, like, \\\"Oh, that's no big deal, I can just take that back and have them buff that out...\\\"  It's, like, if it's \\\"no big deal,\\\" then why didn't you have that done before you delivered the car?  It makes me wonder if there aren't other things you're trying to slip by me, y'know?\\n\\nSpeaking of trying to slip one by... while I was waiting for my car to be \\\"buffed,\\\" I was looking over the invoice.  Admittedly, I didn't understand one word written on there (other than my own name), but I did see a $100.00 charge for towing.  I couldn't understand how that charge was implemented seeing as how I drove my car to their facility, this time.  When the employee returned with my vehicle, I asked about this charge, \\\"What is this $100.00 for towing?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That was for towing the vehicle,\\\" they said, again, with an air of condescension.\\n\\n\\\"No shi... kidding,\\\" I responded.\\n\\n*silence and staring*\\n\\n\\\"Why is it on my bill?\\\" I asked.\\n\\n\\\"Because you had the car towed,\\\" they stated.\\n\\n\\\"No, I didn't,\\\" I defended.\\n\\n\\\"Are you sure?\\\" They asked.\\n\\n\\\"I'm more sure that I didn't have this vehicle towed than I am that you're trying to rip me off for $100.00,\\\" I heard this statement escape my lips on its own.\\n\\nSo, after \\\"researching\\\" the questionable charge, it was revealed that another employee accidentally added their towing charge to my ticket.  I don't know that I necessarily believe that, but since I can't prove otherwise, I'll go ahead and take that statement at face value.\\n\\nI'm giving this place four stars because I'm averaging my first five-star experience with my most recent three-star ordeal."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good"}]}

Located inside Aliante Hotel and Casino, a locals casino, this small buffet can be found. The only reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars is because of their \\\"Hawaiian\\\" night every Tuesday. They have Hawaiian treats such as Kahlua pork, pineapple upside down cake, etc. \\n\\nBut the real highlight of Hawaiian night is their lechon...which would grab any Filipino's undivided attention! This was the only reason I went here on gym night. We got a table, grabbed a plate and looked for a big flock of Filipinos. If you see a big group of Filipinos in one spot, it's either they're gossiping about somebody or there's lechon in that spot! There's a reason why Anthony Bourdain calls lechon \\\"the best pork\\\" he has ever eaten! I love pork too and I like cochinillo from Madrid and lechon from Cebu called Zubuchon. Lechon is normally served at an important event such as a wedding, graduation, baptism, family reunion (or whatever reunion) and birthdays. My excuse is it's still my birthday.\\n\\nSo we found the lechon...chopped up and ready for the pickins. Ooh, there were bottles of MANG TOMAS to dip your porky treat in. A testimony of legitness. I filled my first plate of just lechon: meat and crispy skin...and a spot for Mang Tomas. I don't eat rice because I'm a weird Asian. The meat was nice although there were some parts that were dry. Tip: for juicy pork, pick the part closest to the bone. If you want fatty, tender cuts, get the belly...the only down side to that is you could be crunching on pig nipples. But whatever. Eat the skin while it's still hot. I know most of us like taking lots of pictures of what we're about to eat so we have something to post on Yelp and social media websites...you're putting yourself at great risk of stabbing/cutting your gums if the once crispy pork skin gets cold. Lechon doesn't let you mess around! It's serious business. The only fine detail they forgot was the apple inside the pig's mouth.\\n\\nThey have the usual buffet desserts: pies, cakes, gelato, frozen yogurt/ soft-served ice cream, fruits, etc. i like the frozen yogurt and spumoni gelato. I tried the pineapple upside down cake which was more muffin than it was cake. But I still liked it.\\n\\nSo yeah, LECHON TUESDAYS!!! Hoy! For only $20 you can eat as much lechon your arteries would allow you to eat before clogging up and if you/ your tito/tita, ate/kuya have/has an Aliante players card, it's only $15/person! Compare the savings if you got your own lechon for $100-200 depending on the size of the pig because nobody in town will sell lechon in small portions - you get the whole pig or none at all."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good"}]}

The rice is now more brown and doesn't have the same perfect taste. The cheese even changed momentarily from feta to mozzarella.

I actually have not been back again since because I can't figure out what kind of rice they are using on the regular.\\n\\nIn any case, despite my rice saga, the owner is usually very nice when I see him.

I was told to go to another register in a rather apathetic and dismissive demeanor. Prior to today, approx. 56 days ago, I took in 8 items to sell and 7 of them sold. They were decent labels (BCBG dresses, Coach purse, Elie Tahari skirt, Cache leather skirt, Italian suede blazer, Banana Republic skirt, etc.) and what I received in return in cash was $55. I asked Jenny (sales person) if I could take home my 1 remaining item and they wanted to charge me $5.00 to do so (and that charge will be going up soon according to Jenny and the sign she brusquely pointed to). It was because it was an item they had priced under $25. \\\"It's in the contract\\\" Jenny so gruffly explained. So when taking your clothes for consignment I highly suggest that you stay current on your contract so you know exactly what kind of exchange you will experience from them. Apparently they make changes to your contract whenever they see fit and do not notify you of the changes other than the signs they post in-store. Be cautious and informed before doing business here. I've had my account there for years and I've never felt so dismissed by the sales persons (esp. Jenny), so uninformed, and frankly, ripped off. Bottom-line: Doing business with My Sisters Closet feels bad. I will not be taking my items to be sold there to receive very little in return and to be treated so poorly for being a client of theirs. I'd rather donate my clothes to a good cause, get a tax write-off that I believe is a better financial decision and, more importantly, feel good about doing it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Bad"}]}

Let me just tell you - except for very few exceptions, all of the rooms are the same.  All rooms are about 400 sf and you either get one king sized bed or two queen sized beds.  The variation in price of up to $50 per night is solely based on the view.  There are 5 buildings that surround a pool, lagoon and courtyards in a U-shape.  As you can imagine, there are rooms facing these facilities and some rooms facing the parking lot.  Even if you want to save money, DO NOT get a room that faces the parking lot.  It will feel like a motel.  The rooms that face the facilities are all pretty much the same and there's no real reason to pay extra for the pool view or lagoon view rooms.  In fact, those rooms may be noisier and have less privacy due to the amount of traffic from other hotel guests.\\n\\nIf I had a dog, this place would be heaven. Dog-friendly hotels are not as common as they should be and even those that are tend to put all of the dog owners in the old/nasty part of the hotel.  Not the case here - dogs ruled the resort and I didn't mind at all.\\n\\nThe best part of the experience was the free wine reception every evening from 5pm to 6pm.  Let's just say that I got my money's worth.  We stayed 3 nights and each of us got 2 glasses of wine each evening. No, it's not the best wine but who cares when it's free.\\n\\nThe firepits are also very cool but there's a limited number of them and they are always in high demand.  I also love that there's self-parking all around the hotel so you can leave your vehicle close to your room for easy access.\\n\\nThe hotel is good but not perfect.  For example, one day we were out from 9am to 3pm and when we returned, the room was still not made up.  I found that to be inexplicable and unacceptable.  I had to locate housekeeping to clean the room.  When we returned to the room 2 hours later, the room was clean but the maid had put 2 identical toothbrushes next to each other.  We had left one on the left side of the sink and one on the right side.  It's pretty stupid for someone to move them so we couldn't tell which one was whose.  When I called guest services to ask for new toothbrushes, they took forever to deliver them to the room.\\n\\nBut the overall experience was fine.  The hotel doesn't look as amazing as the website shows (but does it ever?).  We ended up paying about $150 including tax for 3 adults and considering the amount of wine we drank, I think we got a good value out of it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good"}]}

I've been to Vegas several times and normally opt to stay off the strip due to fact that most of the reasonably priced hotels on the strip are extremely old so when I found a under $200 rate at a new modern hotel I was geeked!!!\\n \\nUnfortunately that ended fairly soon. \\n\\nROOM: Great looking, very modern & spacious, yet there is no real direction as to how everything works. Took me 15-20 minutes to get things working properly and even then I had several lights that I could not get to turn on. also the only outlets are at the front of the room by the tv. No night stand outlets so if you are like me and like having you phone close to you at all times, charge it during the day else be forced to get up out of bed in the middle of the night to answer it.\\n\\nFRONT DESK: Very friendly yet sometimes inefficient.  Had to call several times about getting my lights fixed. Internet wouldn't work properly and they kept transferring me to the wrong people to fix it. Called for an extension cord so that I could work comfortably in my bed b/c the outlet is soooooo far away and she talked to me as if it was the silliest thing they've ever heard.  Let how odd is it that I would want an outlet near me so I could work from my bed or answer my phone!\\n\\nCONCIERGE: They just seemed confused. The last time I visited Vegas I used the monorail to get around the strip. Being that the city center is so new and I asked about trains, buses, monorails to get back and forth.  Th e1st concierge told me about the free shuttle to get to Bellagio. The 2nd told me about the RTC bus. The 3rd told me to walk to MGM grand and get the monorail. None of them actually got me to where I was trying to go.  I just ended up taking a taxi because they confused me even more.\\n\\nELEMENTS: This is their 24 hour one stop shop although looking from the outside you would never know this.

This place takes reservations. Most dinner times of 5-9 are a two month out for a reservation. Lunch recently began to be served. Lunch dress code is relaxed and dinner is business casual. Dress code is enforced.\\n\\nExperience. At arrival we are greeted immediately at the base of stairs to confirm our lunch reservation. Also confirmed and greeted at the front desk. She kindly informs us to wait a few moments to try the photo booth to the left and are escorted to our tables.\\n\\nOur server Anthony arrived in a timely manner to introduce himself and his help. He was kindly insured we placed a drink order. We were unsure on what to order and he described some of his favorite beverage choices. Giada's Sangria with Brachetto and Fortunella 1958 with Don Julio were the drinks we ordered. Anthony kindly informed us that restaurant was out of Don Juilo and was substituting with Patron. Rare to find a restaurant out of beverage. Without Don Julio I went with my second choice Barbarella 1968 with Tanqueray Ten. Waiter respected and agreed with my opinion and affirmed the second choice was his favorite drink. \\n\\nDrinks were served and food order was taken without delay. Both drinks I would describe as a good balance with alcohol and freshly matched ingredients. Sangria was crisp and savory. Barbarella similar to a Moscow Mule was harmony of gin, ginger beer, fresh lemon and basil. Drinks ordered were refreshing for the hot temperatures outside of the restaurant. Alcohol was not over powering either. \\n\\nAnthony made suggestions for the meal. We followed some suggestions and ordered others. We ordered appetizers from the antipasti meat and cheese including Chicken Marsala Meatballs, and Pecorino Tartufo with Apricot Preserves served with fresh made flat bread and dipping sauce. Dipping sauce similar to that of a pesto. Yum. Pairing flat bread with pecorino and apricot spread just magnificent. The components of pecorino worked well on its own and together. Harmony. \\n\\nMeatballs paired with vine roasted tomatoes in a savory Marsala. Tender soft meatballs. Sauce was flavorful and one of the best I had. Tomatoes lightly toasted to maintain it's integrity. As a whole this was a nice antipasti. Pieces were good on its own but in my opinion lacked a little cohesion for the appetizer. This item is on their dinner menu and I would still order it. \\n\\nWe ordered from the sandwiches from servers suggestions. Muffuletta sandwich with mortadella, finocchoina, porchetta, prosciutto cotto, and aged provolone. Similar to an Italian salumi trio, was bursting with spice and fair amount of provolone on a fresh rustic bread. Prepared warm from the grill, this is what a  sandwich should be. This sandwich pays true homage to the influences of Giada's family into the restaurant. Sandwich is served with choice of arugula salad or zucchini scapecce. Arugula salad was elected to pair with this. Lightly dressed and topped with parmesan that hit an accord with the sandwich. I couldn't complain if this was the only thing I ordered. Between the muffuletta sandwich and arugula salad I think I could eat all day without feeling guilty.\\n\\nOther sandwich was the Lobster Roll with lemon basil aioli and fried capers. The roll was by far one of the best deals on the menu. Ten ounces of lobster piled on a roll with the citrus aioli was succulent, creamy, savory, and sweet. Nothing over powering just right and not too aromatic with the lobster and citrus. Paired this with the zucchini scapecce like a zucchini onion strings. Not greasy but crispy enough with flavor to enjoy on it's own or pair with the lobster roll. Lightness of the zucchini paired nicely to the sandwich. Both light sides were good pairings. \\n\\nOverall the appetizers, sandwiches, sides, and drinks were great. Service was outstanding. Restaurant as a whole was refreshing, exceeded the expectations and hype. The restaurant reflects the pride, tradition which tributes to Giada's family and California influences. I would make sure I had a reservation the next time I am out to Las Vegas. A must try if you like food. \\n\\nServer was very personal and knowledgeable of menu. Server was efficient, friendly, and well articulated. It showed with suggestions. We enjoyed the meal from some suggestions he made and our own selections. Serve, wait, and host staff worked well like a oiled machine or an orchestra on key.\\n\\nOverall four stars for exceptions from a slight delay on the check to get to us, a little pricy, and no clue what lunch was because lunch menu (just started serving lunch) was not available until we ate there. Five stars on food, service, and drinks. \\n\\nWe had plenty on our list of things to do for this Vegas trip and this is a definite return place for us."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good"}]}

Tithe chips were topped with cheese, BBQ sauce, smoked chicken and jalape\\u00f1os. They were tasty. The smoky chicken made them amazing. The chili came in a small crock. It was bubbling and hot.

I was going to share them but after tasting them I no longer wanted to share. The wings are not winglets and they aren't fried. They are whole wings and they are grilled. They are the best wings I've ever had. I was kind enough to share . . . This time. \\nFor dessert we ordered peach cobbler. It was a little different from normal cobblers.

I have been frequenting this place for over 7 years now and NOT ONCE has it compromised in taste, style or service. I know when I go there years from now, I will get to enjoy every reason that makes this place special for me. Taste-wise, I can speak for the pizza, wings and beer as this is all I ever want when I go...BECAUSE THERE SO DAMN GOOD!!! The pizza has an amazing taste to the sauce that can only be experienced and that will hopefully one day be recognized as the sauce all pizza should use! The wings have a nice crunchiness but are still traditionally bathed in an awesome wing sauce and worth every bit of mess you make of yourself. The beer is served right and makes the food that much better. When I say served right; I'm speaking of the thick, LARGE, glass pitcher that you could use to battle any incoming zombies or just use it to fill up the ice dripping mugs! Keep in mind, this place has a huge menu so don't think there only as good as pizza and wings. Best of all is it is very affordable as I have never thought I paid too much and if your looking for a cheap lunch special, they have it! As for atmosphere, it is very down to earth, no frills, just some beer signs and simple pictures of Napoli or some far off Italian hillside. The exact same group of guys has been there every time I have went and I actually don't know if they ever leave. Every time you see them they are cleaning or breaking down some machine to clean because it took a beating during lunch time. These guys have an awesome \\\"tough as nails\\\" Italian attitude and can come off pushy when placing your order for lunch but for god sake it's lunch time; it's busy, live with it! For dinner, you order it up front and then they bring it to you instead of picking it up from the front and don't worry, at this time the guys are all very gracious. Overall, this place is a classic and if your looking for great pizza in Phoenix; this is your place, if you just feel like something a little better for a pizza to take home; this is your place; if you want a genuine, down to earth experience; this is your place!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Very Good"}]}

I will not be returning to this theater again and I am surprised they are still in business. I bought a groupon over a year ago and forgot that I had purchased them. I read on the groupon that the amount I spent on the tickets would still be validated through Studio Movie Grill, however, the actual groupon purchased for 2 tickets and 2 drinks for 10.00 would not be validated. My understanding was that I would have 10.00 to spend at the theater. When I logged onto my groupon for the day to print the tickets I noticed they had the same promotion going on for the 2 tickets and 2 small drinks. I figured I would call the theater to see if they may honor what I purchased through groupon since they were currently offering the same \\\"newer\\\" promotion. I called the theater several times and they do NOT have anyone answering phones. I tried all of the automated numbers and not a single human answered the phone. They offer to call you back but I took my break at work to call and cannot receive calls at work seeing as I work in a hospital with patients and I am constantly on my feet. So my coworker and I decided to see the Purge on Tuesday night at 520pm. We grabbed a nice happy hour at the Four Peaks nearby and went over to the theater at 5:10pm. Upon arrival to the front \\\"purchase\\\" desk, I asked the girl if they would consider honoring my expired groupon since they were doing the same promotion presently. She looked confused mummbled something, said I dont know and than began to charge us the full price for the movies. I decided that 4.00 was not a huge issue and she clearly did not know how to ask someone for the answer considering she had no anwer herself. As my friend and I went to find the theater for our movie we noticed that she charged us for Iron man 3 which had started 15 minutes prior to our purchase, and it was the wrong movie. So not only was she incompetent in finding out an answer, she was not competent in our purhcase of the correct movie. We returned to the front desk with the manager seeking the correct movie. I noticed there were two young blonde employees at this point. The newest employee was being asked the question of what are matinee times by a young couple arriving to the movie theater. Her response consisted of looking at the manager several times... the manager helping my friend and I, and then stating...\\\"they are in the afternoon.\\\" I could not believe that an employee was not knowledgeable on what times a mantinee consisted of. So my friend and I went to sit down in the theater now having the purchase of the correct movie. The seats were moderately comfortable and I felt as though I was in a conference center preparing for a powerpoint presentation. The staff was loud during the entire movie taking orders from the other patrons which was distracting. The menu we received to order from stated that Tuesdays were ladies nights and ladies could receive 5.00 movies all day and night long. We had paid 7.00 per ticket and not offered the ladies night price. At the end of the movie my friend and I exited the theater at which point I noticed a different manager from who had helped us previously. I went up to him and asked him why we were not honored the ladies night price and he said that we could not be honored that with a groupon. I said that my groupon had expired and it stated that it was a 10.00 gift certificate to the theater...so why not just offer the guests the 5.00 price? He said no and I said well thank you, over four dollars I will not be returning to your theater and I plan on writing a review. His response consisted of an \\\"ok.\\\" As many times as I've seen groupon offering deals to this theater it is CLEAR they need more patrons and are not making enough money. Maybe they need to consider a change in employees, consider training employees on competencies and managers on satisfying patrons over FOUR DOLLARS. Had my friend and I received the slightest amount of good customer service and compassion we would probably return to the theater but due to the lack of customer service and employee knowledge you couldn't pay me to return to this theater. I would highly recomment amc cinema suites for they have a more knowledgeable and helpful staff and way more comfortable seating. I do not see Studio Movie Grill maintaining their business much longer and that projection is also based on how often they have to offer groupon prices to just get patrons to come see a movie."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Very Bad"}]}

I really love the I-Naba chain. Back when I was still living in Los Angeles County, they had a I-NABA in the South Bay area. The one thing I remember about the place was how good they treated my Dad on account of him being such a popular figure in the Los Angeles Japanese-American community. I always thought it was funny how they always kissed his ass and treated him like royalty. At this Las Vegas location, they never heard of him. \\n\\nWhen people say that I-Naba is the best Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas, I can easily understand why people would say that. This place has introduced a dish which is extremely popular in Japan to the morbidly uncultured people of Las Vegas. Even though I personally believe that Shogu and Hiro's famous \\\"Sushi-on-Rainbow\\\" restaurant is the best and even the most culturally significant Japanese restaurant in LV, I can see why some people may say I-NABA is the bees nees. In fact, I agree that I-NABA is much greater than Ichiza or any of the poke-MON restaurants.  \\n\\nI love buckwheat soba. I really love buckwheat soba. I have eaten Zaru Soba every single night for the last 6 months. It's a great source of complex carbohydrates, and it helps keep my weight down. If you are a narcissistic pretty boy like me, I really recommend replacing your carb source with buckwheat soba. It gives you that energy you need to workout hard, with the fiber and health benefits as an added bonus.  \\nEvery Zaru Soba fan would much prefer to go to one of these soba places that actually have their noodles specifically made for their restaurant. You can get Zaru Soba at Shuseki and Ichiza but they use the same noodles that you get at places like Nakata Market of Japan or Japan Creek Market. Don't get me wrong, I ain't knocking Shuseki. In fact, Shuseki is my favorite noodle house in Vegas, but when you taste the freshly made noodles at I-NABA, you will immediately recognize the difference in taste. \\n\\nThe girl who works here is really fun to talk with. Last time I was here we had a conversation about Japanese identity. She is half-Japanese/White, and I'm half-Japanese/Korean. So, it was one of the more interesting conversations I have had this year. \\n\\nI-NABA also holds the unique title of having my very favorite Vegetable Tempura.  The vegetables they use taste organically grown, and they slice them so nice in that symmetrically perfect style. I really like places that make their own Tempura dipping sauce in house. I can only think of 2 other places in LV that do this(SushiTwister and Sushi on Rainbow). \\n\\nI really wish I could eat here everyday or at least more often. Problem is that I work 60 hours 7 days a week. By the time I get off work this place is usually closed. I heard that they might start opening later when they get their liquor license. I hope it's soon."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Very Good"}]}

Every time someone brought up burger joints, Smash was a destination worth mentioning. It was never the first on the list, but as I continue to cross out places I have tried, it was time to give them a taste.\\n\\nWhen I entered, the cashier greeted me and asked if I had been there before. Usually when you reply no, the other person would explain, but he just asked for my order. That was not a big deal because I am usually set before I step anywhere near the register. The customer service was good overall, because when I did not order a drink, the cashier offered me a cup for water.\\n\\nI had a job interview today, so I opted for the avocado club smash chicken sandwich because it did not have anything that would leave a lingering smell. If it was any other day, I probably would have gone for a burger with the works. The chicken breast was cut in two to cook faster, I liked this style because it allowed the meat to stay moist and juicy. Often the breast dries out and become overcooked if left whole. On top of that, they add four crisp strips of bacon, four slices of avocado, ranch, mayo, lettuce and tomato on a whole wheat bun. The sandwich is delicious, but pricey for the university area. At $7.99, you can go to In-N-Out and get a double double combo meal with a shake. At Smash, for the price of everything you would get next door, it would run you close to fifteen dollars. The food is good, but for that price I would probably go to Bachi Burger or Holsteins. I could pay a little more for a more unique meal."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mediocre"}]}

I was attracted to the fact that they include a lot of free classes & all the yoga you could want, it is big enough to have your own space and it has a Kidszone.\\n\\nPros:  \\n\\n1. As far as I can tell, I have always been able to get on equipment that I want. I normally don't go at peak hours so I can't tell you if this is true all the time\\n\\n2. Locker room seems clean, has two saunas and a steam room if you are into that. Plenty of lockers between the two in the building.\\n\\n3. Doesn't have a smelly gym smell to the workout area or locker room. \\n\\n4. Easy to get into classes if you plan just slightly ahead. Some classes are more popular than others. Over all very good yoga instructors. \\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Kidszone is a complete joke!\\n\\nThey either need to embrace the concept or give it up. Right now, it's a poor excuse for a place to take your kids while you work out. It would seem like the person who is responsible for managing the Kidszone isn't a parent or forgets what it was like to have little kids....\\n\\nThe kids play area is lacking any real activities. I have a 5 & 3 yr old and they absolutely hate going there. They say it is boring and I can't blame them. There are a few mats to play on and not much more. There needs to be something more to play with... ie: TOYS! You know, those things kids love to play with... They don't have to be fancy... a few books, some blocks, a few cars and trucks, maybe a small dramatic play area.....  It doesn't take much to keep a kid busy for an hour but they really need more than a few gym mats.\\n\\nAlso, they won't change diapers or help older children use the restroom... What?? If you are going to have a kidzone, it comes with the territory.... Diapers, maybe but little kids & bathroom, you need to help them if they're toilet trained. The restrooms are not equipped for little kids so it would be hard for a little kid to get up on the toilet. Also, anyone who has little kids know that they may have to go 20 mins after they just went...  If you won't change diapers, you need to have a bathroom equipped to change diapers... diaper changing table would help! \\n\\nNon-engaging kidszone employees. Being so close to Univ of WI, you would think Capitol Fitness would have access to a ton of early childcare majors or even early education students who would like to have a chance and work at a place to gain some real work experience.   At least from the the few times I was there, there was no real engagement happening between the employee and the kids.   It's like my neighbor's kids are watching my kids. \\n\\nOn the flip side, if Capitol Fitness is just doing the kidszone so they can say they have one but don't really want to have kids actually in the gym, then they are very successful.  \\n\\n2. Parking is definitely a hassle during the week if you want to be close. If you don't want to pay for parking, go after 6:00 pm when the meters stop or park a few blocks away in the neighborhood.\\n\\n3. The interior of the gym is definitely looking somewhat dated. It's dark and dim. The atmosphere is sort of muted and not very motivating. The gym is starting to show it's age.\\n\\n4. Not a lot of sanitize wipes  / hand sanitizer around which is why I see people skipping off the equipment without cleaning it.   I've been in gyms where they are all over the place so it unavoidable not to clean the equipment after you are done.\\n\\n5. Towels. I know people already talked about this. I will say that they do have a ton of hand towels and a limited number of small gym towels available to use without charge.  If you need to take a shower but forget to bring your own, you could make due with two smaller gym towel. \\n\\nOverall, the gym is about average and you get what you pay for ($44 mth). My old gym in DC was twice the cost but provided twice the service.  So for this price range and if you exclude the consideration of a kidzone, I would say the gym is average. There are better gyms in the Madison which are probably a better value compared to service but, you have to drive out in suburbs to go there... if you live anywhere near west, near east or downtown, this is probably your only choice for a full service fitness center. Until Capitol Fitness has a full service gym close by as it's competitive, we probably won't see much change.   \\n\\nThe Bright Side!\\nThere are a lot of new big buildings going up in the next few years on the E. Washington Ave corridor so it will be just a matter of time until we'll see so other gym move into the area... It's up to Capitol Fitness Management to see if they can stay ahead and keep the gym relevant before people leave for something better..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mediocre"}]}

After the ordeal, I wrote an appropriate letter to the owner, asking for compensation, and there was no response. I am willing to always give a positive yelp, but this was unconscionable. BUYER BEWARE! \\n\\nThis is what happened:\\n \\nMy two granddaughters and I arrived at Nail & Spa at about 5:30 PM, February 22, 2014. We picked our colors, and were invited to sit and start. There was some conversation about who I was, and what we were doing. I explained I was from California, and wanted to take them to get their nails done. After establishing who I was a where I was from, the people doing the pedicures continued to talk to each other, and every so often \\\"California\\\" would pop out in their dialog with each other. This made it uncomfortable for us as we knew we were being talked about, but not talked to.\\n\\nThe conversation: \\nWhile I was sitting there with my feet in the water, I explained I wanted a manicure, also. I said, \\\"Just a manicure, no nail polish.\\\" Mia (I think that was her name) said, \\\"$37\\\" (pointing at one granddaughter), \\\"$37\\\" (pointing to the other granddaughter) and \\\"$47\\\" (pointing to me). I went into shock thinking, \\\"Holy cow, what the heck is this place?\\\" My mind was reeling with sticker-shock on this high-priced quote. My granddaughter mouthed to me, \\\"Did she say $37?\\\" I nodded my head, yes. She was wide-eyed, also. I could not relax from that point on, nor could my granddaughter. It was like I was being financially raped. Mia kept asking me if it felt good while she was rubbing stuff on my legs. I was so consumed with the cost that all I could do was nod my head, and wonder why it was $37 to get a pedicure. The final insult was when she went to do my nails she whipped out a nail buffer, and started buffing without asking me. Then she says it will be $5 more. I did not even WANT my nails buffed. I have thin nails, and when you buff them, they fray apart. \\n\\nUpon leaving, my granddaughter asked the girl at the desk how much a pedicure is. She said, \\\"$23\\\" (I believe) That was when I knew I had been taken advantage of. Mia did not offer the basic pedicure. She had only told us one option, and it was the most expensive. I believe this is bad customer service. My granddaughter is so upset; she does not want to go back there again for her brows. Both of my granddaughters insisted on giving me some money to compensate for the cost. That is NOT how that was supposed to turn out! \\n\\nI would NOT have posted this bad yelp if the owner had made it right, but I am writing this on April 23, 2014 and he has had plenty of time to respond. I cannot say that the pedicure was worth the price in any way. I was not happy with the actual pedicure work that was done, even if I was only paying the basic cost of $23.\\n\\nAll I can say is if a business practices these tactics, beware!

I can definitely say that the customer service was FAR FAR better--someone actually asked me if I needed help!  That was good.  The place felt quite a bit more alive than the last time I was here.  A recent review of this place by another Yelper described it as \\\"a tomb.\\\"  Last time I was here, yes.  This time, at least at the time I visited, no.\\n\\nBut let's cut to the chase--the reason why you visit a bookstore is, well, BOOKS!  Customer service only goes so far if what you carry is no good (and this is true for many kinds of businesses.)  I have been to a number of metaphysical stores in my day both in California and Arizona, and this one still stinks in their book selection.  Sure, the fluff sells in bulk and you need to carry it.  But, you need MORE than that.  Either the owner or the book buyer or both need to visit Alpha Book Center, Fantasia, and Northern Winds in Phoenix to find out what kind of inventory a REAL METAPHYSICAL BOOKSTORE really has in stock.  This place has enough space to carry the full book inventory of all three of these stores combined--if it did, they'd get a LOT more business from Wiccans, New Agers, and Occultists of all different stripes who would go there to get the stuff they need.  Bulk herbs would be another nice addition--all they have are the same-old same-old incense sticks and oils.  \\n\\nInstead of aiming to be a provider to the metaphysical community in the Valley (and this is an ample community), they seem to be relying on their tarot card readers, psychics, authors, presenters, and aura photographers to bring in the bucks.  Good, but not good enough.\\n\\nA little better overall.  Come on Vision Quest!  You guys have the space and the potential--now DO SOMETHING with it!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Bad"}]}

Not only did they say it would be great, they would have drink specials and have the happy hour menu available to our guests. And also, the manager had told me and another colleague there's hardly any business on Thursday, so it was great to have an organization interested in having a mixer at The District.  Thursday night came, the level of customer service and professionalism that the manager gave us was HORRIBLE!  The way he treated me, others and the fact that we brought about 70 to 100 people there itself was definitely something to remember.  NOT only did they lie about accommodating our large group obviously The District could not do so, nor did the management team care to do so.   The place was already crowded with other guests which is great for them HOWEVER, the manager never tried to accommodate all our guests which they knew we were coming! ...for seating, passing out menus..the only way people were able to order if they were seated which they couldn't,  some individuals were waiting a very long time for a drink that cost $15, there were no drink specials besides the beer and possibly the wine, I never I saw the menu, but I do know people were not happy with purchasing a tiny drink for $15 a pop! The manager did speak to another individual with my guests at one point and had told him, individuals can not get drink specials at the bar, however, there was nowhere to sit , the majority of the tables were already pre occupied.   Also, the executive director of the non profit organization that I work for had ordered just a Dr. Pepper, he gave the bartender a $20, received the drink and never received his change, when he asked the bartender, the bartender took his name down and did not give him his change.  HE HAS YET TO RECEIVE HIS CHANGE FOR A DR. PEPPER.  \\n\\nI never received a thank you for bringing people to The District that night.  IT WAS VERY DISORGANIZED AND VERY UNPROFESSIONAL TEAM AT THE DISTRICT.  \\nAlso, the manager had said to me and the executive director  that we would receive free valet parking since we were at The District, we had to pay over $40 for parking.   It was a very frustrating night.\\n \\nBottom line, we truly did not feel welcome at The District.  I was put in the predicament where I had to clear up confusions and make my guests feel welcomed.  At one point had considered having a kickoff party and/or mixers at The District, bringing over 100+ guests, but after the customer service/treatment everyone received from the management team and wait staff, I am now reconsidering ever utilizing The District and the Sheraton. As for myself, I was very disappointed and had expected great service.\\nTHIS IS THE FUNNY PART!  I did receive (a week later) an email from Heinrich Stasiuk, District GM.  Very insincere apology, THE FUNNY PART...he attached the email to the ongoing inside conversation between the managers stating I was difficult (sorry but you promise me certain things, should be able to keep it!) also stated in the email \\\"but they made good money from us\\\" .if you are a business or non profit organization trying to find a place to hold your mixer or dinners, I hope either you reconsider or let them know you've read my review!

Seriously, who doesn't have a good time in Vegas? The first room we had (we were talked into upgrading for $15 more per night) was on the 14th floor in the Mardi Gras tower above the pool. This was a mistake. We were told there was a band that played outside until about 2am. Well, the band lasted well after 4:00am. We thought we wouldn't be able to hear it, but we did, LOUD and clear. After a sleepless night, we (with the help of the fabulous Courtnie) changed to the 12th floor on the \\\"quiet side.\\\" Quiet my butt! All day/night long we could hear the squeaky elevator gears. It was almost as loud as the band. Because we didn't want to change rooms again, we dealt with it (with pillows over our ears) for the remainder 2 nights. \\nAll in all, I would recommend 1) not upgrading and 2) making sure you want the quiet side NOT by the elevators (in the Mardi Gras tower)\\nIn terms of overall experience at Harrah's - the staff is all super nice! From Courtnie at Check-in, to the waitresses, to the ladies at the gift shop - they have all nailed customer service! I would have to say, however, the drink ladies are sparse. Go to the $1 machines and they'll be by every few minutes. Go to the penny machines and you'll be waiting up to 20 minutes.\\nDEFINITELY sign up for their Total Rewards card. You can use it at a ton of their sister properties for just about anything - from food, to drinks, to swag. I've seen other people say they get free rooms, but we didn't. We must not have gambled enough. \\nOverall, we will keep Harrah's in mind next time we visit Vegas. \\n\\nPS Try Ice Pan.

My negative review of the budget rent a car at the Phoenix airport is mainly about the rudest individual working there that I have ever come in contact with. We picked up our car at 145pm on Friday, November 7, 2014.  I made our reservation through costco travel as I do most times when we go somewhere as their rates are the best. I had my confirmation loaded in my trip it App on my phone. Their system at this location of taking a number and being seated to wait your turn was great! No standing in line, instead comfortably seated in the waiting area waiting for your number to be called. This took about 15 minutes. Not horrible. Unfortunately my pleasant experience ended there. I was asked to go to a window where agent Barb was to help me. She was unable to locate our reservation. I showed her my confirmation on my phone and she immediately told me it was not their confirmation number. I advised that I had booked through costco to which she rudely responded, \\\"we aren't the only company they use, try next door\\\". I assured her the reservation was with budget but she insisted I was mistaken and again suggested I go next door. I began looking through my emails to find the confirmation to see if it included budgets confirmation number. When I found the email, I handed over my phone to her. She scrolled through it then shoved my phone in my face and said, look, this is OUR confirmation number not the other one you gave me. What difference does it make? Do you have a reservation or not? She was now able to locate the reservation and proceeded. Never was there an apology or explanation. Next I had to endure what can not be described as anything other than badgering me into additional insurance. I understand they encourage their workers to do this and may even bonus them on their success in some way. I get that. But when I say no thank you six times, I truly don't want it! She went on to make me feel like a degenerate for not taking it as it could cost tens of thousands of dollars if something were to happen. This is easily at least the hundredth car I've rented over the years and I'm very clear on the risk of using my own insurance over theirs. I didn't need schooling from this rude individual.

There is a bar area but the rest of the tables are set up in a funky circular fashion.  Tables are pretty close to each other and you will not have a private dining experience.  \\nService:  For the most part good.  We were seated right away.  It did take a while for the server to get to us (and she apologized).  She didn't give us the Sushi Samba intro like I heard another server give the table next to us (explaining the whole fusion thing).  Orders were taken and things proceeded to go smoothly.  There were no mistakes on our order.  We asked for sake recommendations and she appeared really knowledgeable.  She was decent in explaining their omikase (pretty much no set omikase).  Food came out at a decent pace.  Water was refilled quite nicely too.\\nFood:  Past review said that this was a great sushi place.  I disagree.  If you want the best sushi, you don't go to a fusion place in Vegas for it.  If you want to try a different twist on japanese/brazillian cuisine, then this is the place. So I went here without much expectations.  Highlights included the Yellowtail taquitos (more like tacos).  I loved the sauce/foam that came with it.  Very light and a nice way to wet your appetite.  Sea bass and Lamb Robata (sp?) were both really really good.  There was a sweet sauce on both.  Sea bass melted in your mouth.  Came with 2 skewers.  The lamb was a decent size and was sliced thinly.  This was also a melt-in-your mouth experience.  I would order both again. We had one of their specials which was a white fish in a tofu sauce.  It was just ok.  We made the mistake of ordering a roll.  I think it was an El Toro (or something like that) and it came with salmon, cilantro, mozerella cheese, among other things.  The flavor was ok, but the rice in the roll itself was really hard.  Like they had premade it.  Made the whole roll just awful.  I like their sake selection.  We passed on dessert.\\nValue:  Just like vegas, things are pricier. But I thought the vibe was decent.  \\n\\nAll in all, a decent date night place.

Both times we arrived before the check in time and were checked in without a problem.  I booked a 2 bedroom suite for my boyfriend and two of our friends on our Nov 08.  The 2 bedroom suite was amazing! It's a 1 bedroom suite & deluxe suite next to each other.  Both require key entry, but the double doors in the foyer (with a door bell) close, allowing you to keep both of your doors open.  We went grocery shopping before we checked in. \\n\\nHousekeeping was quick and pleasant.  We needed door stops and had them within 15 minutes of our call.  Room service was quick as well, with our order in our room in about 30 minutes.\\n\\nThe 1 bedroom features a full kitchen, which saved us so much money on food and drinks!  We usually spent a couple hours after each night out unwinding with some snacks and a drink before heading to bed.  If you stay in a deluxe suite, avoid getting too many frozen items since you only get a mini fridge.  In fact, try to keep all frozen/refrigerated items to a minimum.  The wifi worked wonderfully both times we stayed.  I actually lost my phone in the casino the second time we stayed, so having the wifi came in handy in going online to notify my service provider.\\n\\nThe bedrooms are so nice.  The tv comes up out of the desk which is pretty cool, although we never actually watched the tv.  I did take advantage of the tv in the bathroom while I got ready.  The beds were super comfy, and everyone got a kick out of the plush white robes in the closets.  I went to sleep early one night while everyone stayed up in the front room, and I could hardly hear them.  In fact, we never heard anyone in any of the rooms around us either, even when we were in the hallways.  The only reason I knew people were on the same floor as us were their dirty dishes from room service in the hall.\\n\\nThe bathrooms are great! From the tvs, to the double sinks, to the soaking dub, separate shower, and enclose toilet.  It was all so nice.  Getting ready was never an issue, my boyfriend and I were out of each others way even when my girl friend came over and was getting ready in there with us.  The bathroom in the deluxe suite is just as nice.  A bit smaller, but much larger than your standard hotel bathroom.  It was still enough room for 2 people to get ready without bumping into each other.\\n\\nThe second time we stayed, we only stayed in a deluxe suite in early 2009.   I actually gave the wrong card and it got declined at check in, and the clerk discreetly wrote down the remaining balance due and quietly explained my card didn't work.  She stayed just as friendly and her demeanor never changed.  I've done this at other hotels *cough*Luxor*cough* and was given a bit of attitude and the decline was made obvious to others checking in around us.\\n\\nIf you're a smoker, be prepared to walk a ways to be able to smoke.  That being said, we would make our smoking trips few and far between, or wait until we got to the casino.  We would go to the front of the tower across the driveway where they had ashtrays.  Of course it feels like a long walk when you've been drinking, but I TOTALLY understand why they keep the smokers far from the entrance.  If I'm a nonsmoker and show up at a nonsmoking hotel, the last thing I want to smell is cigarette smoke.\\n\\nMy husband (was the boyfriend who went with me on both trips) and I are going tomorrow for our honeymoon.  We're staying 4 nights in a deluxe suite.  I'm interested in seeing what our stay is like this time around since it's been a while since we've stayed there, and I've read a few reviews stating the quality has dipped.  I'm going to let them know we're staying for our honeymoon and request a balcony, and see if they give us one, since I didn't want to spend the extra $20 to guarantee a balcony.  We used the stay 3 nights get the 4th night free offer, so I'm curious to see how that works out too."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good"}]}

The bathrooms are stocked with fluffy towels and nice bath products and the bed is really comfortable.\\n\\nIf it was just for the room and the service at the front desk, this place would get a 4 or 4.5 star rating. But there were a few things that bothered me.\\n\\n1. Not sure who the genius was that decided to go with fabric curtains on the inside of the shower instead of plastic, but newsflash idiot, that cotton/silk blend ABSORBS water. What does that mean? It means that every time I take a shower, there's a giant puddle of water on the bathroom floor. Good thing there were plenty of extra towels every day to mop up the mess.\\n\\n2. The hotel is located in the Complex Desjardins and is above a mall so the lobby is actually located on the 6th floor. This means that from the street or garage, you have to take two sets of elevators to get to your room. Not so bad, but when the hotel is busy, you can wait a while for an elevator.\\n\\n3. I am constantly travelling for work or pleasure, which means lots of nights spent in hotels. One thing I've learned in my travels is that the higher the star rating, the nicer the bed/bedding and towels are but the more expensive WiFi costs. I've stayed at cheap rundown hotels that smelled like urine (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/days-inn-conference-center-york#hrid:pjiJL4H3qJIYBzwtcNrNOw) that had free WiFi.

The hotel is located right on Ste Catherine next to the newly renovated festival district. It's right at Place des Arts and a few minutes walk to the old Port or the debauchery that is Ste Catherine street.\\n\\nIn conclusion, use Hotwire.com to book a room in Montreal.

I think I have to agree! I've been to his steakhouse and was happy with my food there, so I was expecting some good food, especially with all the reviews. Sadly I have been excited to try this spot for a long time and I finally did. It was very packed for a week night, around 6 p.m. When we left, there was actually a long line forming. Upon first entering, I was really impressed by the fire lining the window as part of the decoration. The hostesses were standing around, greeted us, and took us right to our table. I was surprised how busy it was in there. There are huge TV screens covering the walls (sports bar-ish but with high price tags), loud music (Vegas all the way), and Gordon's pic all over the place, on the menu, on the wall, everywhere. At first I was very impressed with the whole thing. \\n\\nWhen we sat down our waitress Tammy came over and appeared to be a in a big rush. I ordered the Farm Burger, Hog Burger (love the name), and we got Maui Onion Rings and Truffle Fries. The burgers we got were supposed to be their speciality, so I was really expecting something special. Ummm the Hog Burger was not memorable at all. I can't say I enjoyed it one bit and almost felt like I was just eating it because it was so darn expensive!! ($17 with being a rewards member). The burger wasn't even that big and it just barely had any taste. The toppings were arugula and some sort of sauce, again nothing memorable. The Farm Burger had a nice piece of bacon on it, cheese, and an egg (doesn't sound original but in comparison to the Hog burger, it was decent). I really don't feel like with the high price here for the burgers, these burgers were worth the price. I hate to say it, but the burger was borderline dry. The Maui onion rings and garlic dipping sauce was tasty, but nothing that would bring me back to this restaurant just for that. The truffle fries were thick cut fries and had an overwhelming truffle taste, almost to the point where you felt gross eating such oily fries. \\n\\nI am glad I went and tried it and now my curiosity is over and I will not be back.

Had a good (overpriced) cocktail at the bar, then we were seated at possibly the worst table in the place, despite our months-early reservation. Got a booth back by the server pow-wow area / cash register, next to a massive table of really drunk and really loud patrons. Ok, fine. Ordered many dishes, including small plates, entrees, sushi rolls, etc. My father makes it clear to the waiter he doesn't like mushrooms (this is pertinent later). \\n\\nOur 3 tacos come out - $34 worth of tacos - and they are the SMALLEST, most laughable portion size ever. I literally laughed out loud when they put them down. They were no bigger than lime wedges (I posted a photo). Very good, but ridiculously priced and sized. Ok, fine.\\n\\nThe other dishes start to come out, and they're timed terribly. Sushi after entrees, entrees at different times...I ate alone basically while my companions looked on, waiting for their food. My father's entree comes out and it's the WRONG one. Finally, when his actual dinner arrives, it's covered in mushrooms. The waiter never mentioned that could be a problem when my father placed his order, and the menu mentioned nothing about mushrooms. Ok, fine.\\n\\nMy husband's $80 sashimi chef's special comes out and it's also laughably undersized. Literally 9 pieces of fish for $80. When we go to Morimoto in Philadelphia, a $50 sashimi plate has easily 3x the amount of fish on it. Same quality. I get that it's Vegas but this was a joke. The waiter never explained what fish were on the plate either - just left my husband to guess. This was the last straw.\\n\\nOverall the food is fine, but there are so many other places that serve comparable stuff at way better prices. Nobu is nothing special.

Don't. Get. It.\\n\\nFirst let me start by pointing out something that you guys may have forgotten, you are a secondhand store, not a resale store for gently used merchandise or even a consignment shop.  There *is* a difference.  Your stuff is no nicer than a standard Goodwill's stuff, yet you think you can command about twice the price for your stuff??   Uh, no.\\n\\nYeah, it's clean and organized in comparison to a Goodwill, but it still smells like my grandma's closet, or maybe even my musty garage after a humid day.  Why?  Because it's STILL a secondhand store, full of unwashed goods, of questionable provenance, from other people.\\n\\nI found a wall mounted coat rack that I really liked and would have purchased, but it was $10.   Uh, sorry, but that isn't that awesome of a deal.  And my husband found some well loved, North Face snow pants that would have been a good deal for something slightly less than the $25 they wanted for them, AND if they hadn't also been ripped at the bottom so I would have had to mend them anyway...  c'mon Savers, really?\\n\\nAdding to all this is the fact that they weren't even offering any kind of point of sale discount, coupons, nothing...  At least Goodwill was running a 50% off everything deal that same day.  I did hear an overhead announcement that said that if you register online with Savers and give them your email address they'll send you coupons, but who really wants Spam from a secondhand store?  I certainly don't.  I much prefer a point of sale discount that requires no sharing of my personal contact information, thankyouverymuch.\\n\\nSaver's whether you guys like it or not, Goodwill IS your competition, so you better step up your game to actually compete with them.  I'll be clear, I'm not cheap and I'd like to consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of the secondhand stores across the Valley (hell, I was raised shopping in secondhand stores) but I refuse to pay those kinds of prices for that kind of merchandise.  \\n\\nYou guys need to reexamine your pricing structure because it kinda sucks."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mediocre"}]}

She acted like we were a nuisance to her and gave us dirty looks the whole time. When we asked her for drinks she rolled her eyed and scowled. My fianc\\u00e9 is super sweet and thought she was having a bad day so he tried to cheer her up by complimenting her and  trying to make her laugh but she shot him dirty looks. There was only one other group there and they were obviously wasted. They could barely sing anymore and just kept bouncing around  and goofing off, which is normal for a bar. Except that she treated us like outsiders that didn't belong there. My friends went to cheer and spilled a tiny bit of beer because the glass was full. They were nice enough to apologize and clean it up and Mia told them they have to leave cause they were breaking things. There were 7 of us and not one person saw anything broken.. Just a few drops of beer that they so graciously cleaned up themselves. Mia said she didn't wanna clean up after us so we had to leave. At this point I decided she didn't deserve the nice tip my friend left on the counter. I told her to take it back, and the other bartender, an overweight brunette who's name I don't know, heard me and snatched it up quickly before I could. I had to tell Mia directly that she  gave us the worst service ever and I cannot allow my friend to tip her. She reluctantly gave it back. It takes this much for me to not tip someone. I'm a huge tipper. I work for tips too so I understand how this works, but I would never treat clients like she treated us. I earn my tips.

If you go, I'd recommend the wings and the Tri Tip sandwich, but steer clear of the combo plates. If you have kids, have them split a meal and stay away from the kid meals.

There seems to be something of theme developed along LVBS, with a Salvadorian and another Cuban restaurant in proximity to each other. This one is set in a bland storefront, but once inside the atmosphere feels more Havanian than anything else. The food is simple and spicy and delectable: hot crusty bread and butter, as mentioned in another review, spicy chorizo, steaming rice and beans, chicken that cleaves to the bone, yuca and plantains and pressed cuban sandwiches. The staff seems to be all Cuban, and prepare everything in big pots in the back kitchen. They treat you with genuine hospitality, and aren't particularly concerned with turning the table and running up the tab. Sit there as long as you like and peer through the dusty storefront windows at the sunburnt downtown avenues. It is probably impossible to stay or visit downtown, see the humble immigrant businesses and the few tawdry titty bars set along a background of near shantytowns, and not question how so much glamour and wealth could neighbor such impoverishment. \\n\\nIn any case, turning back to the Rincon interior you'll find one whole wall engulfed by an aging aerial photo of Havana. The picture displays the Malecon sea wall as it weaves along the waterfront. The water is that tepid blue that suggests a photograph from the sixties or seventies.

The combination platter was huge, enough for three people with dolmades, spanikopita, koftes, tzaziki, and hummus.  MBFG is one of the few restaurants in the area that put lamb in the dolmades.  Very delicious! The spanikopita was light, fluffy and perfectly seasoned. The koftes was also very flavorful. I am not a fan of their hummus (too sour), nor their tzaziki (too runny).  Their pita was on the hard side and a little too greasy for my taste. Hubby had the pastitsia which he enjoyed . . . a nice hint of nutmeg sealed the deal. My girlfriend had the Greek salad . . . a big disappointment.  It had all the right veggies, but the dressing tasted like Caesar . . . a major faux pas for my girlfriend who is the Greek food diva!\\n\\nI have been to the Paradise Valley location and the atmosphere is much more spirited and well, it just looks brighter.

It's not going anywhere.\\n\\nWhat I appreciate is unlike other wing-establishments of their kind, their sauce names actually line up to their heat.  If you order a medium hot sauce, it's not mild nor hot.  Their Arizona Ranch sauce is a spectacular mix of medium-ish sauce with ranch dressing.  \\n\\nFor entrees, I'm a fan of the wrap and my wife has actually gotten the steak a couple of times.  She was pleased.\\n\\nThe adult beverages are reasonably priced and a good selection too.  \\n\\nService has always been good for me.  \\n\\nNow I'm thinking I am going to go there after work.

We were there to celebrate our wedding anniversary. I had made reservations a good month and a half before this date. Our time was 5pm. I am a big fan of Giada's on the Food Network, and I knew the food should be great! I thought she would never put her name on a place that wasn't going to be a wonderful place to celebrate an occasion. WRONG!!!!\\n   We went to the bar while waiting for our table, 3 glasses of wine and a tip, $54. We were seated, and I requested a window seat ahead of time, but they put us at a side table where the shutters were barely open. We were given a wine menu, a food menu, then a tasting menu. We were told we all had to order the tasting menu or no one could. Confusing! We were told to order several dishes and share them family style. Our waiter asked if we wanted to speak to the sommelier, which my husband declined, because he knew of most of the bottles on the list, and which one we wanted to order. He brought the wine over, and our one friend declined to have a glass. The waiter said, \\\"maybe you would like a scotch instead?\\\" Our friend said, \\\"as a matter of fact, I would\\\". The waiter said, \\\" I was joking\\\". He brought the scotch. \\n   We then ordered our food, the waiter suggested the antipasti plate. We each placed our order, then the waiter said that would not be enough food for you all, so I am going to order you a lemon spaghetti also. Aaaaaa, we did not ask for that??? In the mean time, the sommelier came over. Again, we did not ask for him. The food all came out, but took along time. Portions were small, but over all, the food was good.\\n   Then things really turned. We sat for a least 15 minutes with our dirty, finished dishes in front of us. Finally, we stacked the dishes in hopes of being noticed. Someone finally came over and removed them. There was no mention of dessert to us. Our waiter came back over and asked if we wanted to see the dessert wine menu. By that time, we were ready to move on out of there. Enough! Between the bar bill and dinner bill and 2 tips we spent close to $ 500, and to top it off there was never a mention on \\\" are you here for any special occasion?\\\"\\n  We took the manager's card. I emailed him a few days later. He responded saying he was out of town and would call me in 2 days. No call came. 5 days after that, I emailed him again. He responded with, a sorry, I am out of town. I will call you tomorrow. Well, guess what?? No call !! Maybe if they had a manager who was around more, the poor service would not happen. Not worth your time and money going there."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Very Bad"}]}

I actually started my journey thinking I would stop at the drip. But when i got there that place just seemed to modern for me. I was in a funky mood and just wanted a nice cup of coffee, nothing fancy. So I saw an older man waving a sign that said \\\"Best lunch in town!\\\" and he was kind of dancing too! And I said to myself \\\"Yes, i think I will\\\". So I stumbled upon MacAlpines. They had just opened and I sat right down at the counter. I had two cups of yummy diner coffee and after realizing I was hungry too, I ordered a stuffed tomato that was oh so yummy with super fresh veggies. The decor was adorable and welcoming and I loved the juke box. 25 cents gets you two plays! anyway, I'm not giving it four stars because it took some time for the staff to warm up and be friendly. I don't know if it was just because they had just opened or if it was because I was still sleeping and needed a caffeine fix badly.

It's tucked away, unseeming, and with little character on the outside.   Frank chose this place on yelp and, to my dismay, we sat in the car justifying our choice for eating here.\\n\\nWe hesitated a bit while walking toward the door, unsure of what lay ahead, but we sucked it up and entered the front door holding our breath and expected the worst (dirty floors, bad service, poor food).  Thankfully, we were wrong.  This cute restaurant has the old school bamboo chairs and tables with menus ready to go.  There are a few servers ready to take your order and watching each table for refills or other needs.  We were seated promptly, received our drink order within a minute and took a good look at the menu.\\n\\nTheir lunch menu is simple--choose a meat, choose a sauce and it's 5.95. We wanted the regular menu, though, so we glanced at it and discovered some interesting dishes we never heard of; two, in fact: Bangkok 9 stripped crispy chicken and the beef.  They both had the same finish--a sweet chili sauce with garlic.  I decided to jump in and try something that sounded different to me, and we ordered off the regular menu at 8 dollars a pop.\\n\\nThe food didn't take long at all, and we were occupied with their lovely steamed (by request) vegetable dumplings that had the thai flavors mixed in.  The sweet soy dip was great, too, and judging by the appetizer we assumed that the lunch itself would be great.  We were right.  First off, the food was beautiful.  The chicken dish was shiny and glazed over with this transluscent, orange chili sauce.  It smelled fantastic.  Although flour coated fried stripped beef doesn't look as appealing, it didn't taste anything like the visual expectation of it.\\n\\nTheir sauce on these dishes are great; sweet, slightly spicy (you can order no heat) and had a garlic (subtle) finish.  The chicken and beef remain nice and crispy despite the sauce, which is something I always look for in fried dishes like that.  It was like eating crispy light pieces of chicken heaven drenched in sweet love.  The plates were piled high, too, so sure enough we had leftovers for lunch the next day.\\n\\nThey provide a bowl of rice enough for 3 - 4 helpings between 2 people, and because the sauce is slightly tangy and sweet (it's really like a thai version of a sweet & sour, but better) the rice is nice to cut that while eating.  By the time we finished the rice bowl was cleaned out and the leftovers neatly packed with more rice (they did it on their own, which was nice).  We patted our tummies and paid a 20 dollar bill (not including tip) that includes 2 dishes, an appetizer and drinks!  Their lunch menu, although cheaper, was good, but I'm so glad we tried their Bangkok 9 dishes instead.\\n\\nIf you're looking for cheap eats in a place where two worlds collide on a plate, try this hidden restaurant in Henderson near Hobby Lobby.  It's good, it's filling, and it doesn't put a hole in your wallet.  You know how I know it was good?  I dreamt about it and craved it the next day.  As a matter of fact I'm going to end this now so I can drive down there for dinner.  Ciao!\\n\\nPS: If any Guam people read this review, remember House of Chin Fee?  The chicken dish I refer to tastes like their sweet & sour chicken.  I grew up on it, so I'm a fan :)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good"}]}

I'm not proud of it and it's a first for me, but sleeping in the bathroom was about the only place I could get some rest.  Had the front desk only informed me that the music and noise coming from Fremont Street Experience was so loud that it penetrates the walls of the Rush Tower hotel rooms facing it, I would have elected to go on the opposite side of the tower.  I was here on business, not by choice, and got the short end of the stick.  People staying here be warned: if you are in the new Rush Tower facing  Fremont Street, the music plays full volume until 3:00am and literally penetrates the windows and walls.  Putting your hand against either of them will reveal the pulsating beats and low-end frequencies of the music being blasted from 100 feet away.  I'm not being elderly about it- I'm in my 30's and enjoy loud concerts....just not when I'm trying to sleep.  \\n\\nI was compensated 1 night free for my troubles (stayed a total of 2 nights).  I'll say that the rooms in the new Rush Tower are nice and hold their own against any of the newer 3 star hotels on the Vegas Strip.  But what good is a nice room if you can't enjoy it?\\n\\nCustomer service was the worst experience I have ever had at any hotel.  When I called at midnight willing to change my room for another, nobody at the hotel was willing to help.  I complained that I was never given a notice about how much noise would be pushing through the wall and it was only met with a mere \\\"well, this is Vegas and the city never sleeps\\\" attitude.  I call B.S..  I've stayed in most of the major hotels lining the strip and have never had an issue with outside noise.  The next day the manager on duty, Orion, told me and my group of 20 business administrators that \\\"he would not\\\" allow us to speak to the General Manager, Brett, because he did not want to bother the GM with an issue like this.  I really can't believe that the words out of his mouth were \\\"I will not do that for you.\\\"  Nice customer service.  He said that in front of a large group of us at the front desk.  This is what we in the business world say should be a \\\"never event.\\\"  As in, me and my group of 20 administrators will never be back to the Golden Nugget based on the poor customer service.  I hope Brett puts a check on the attitudes of the managers because it makes the hotel experience awful and reflects poorly on the hotel management.  \\n\\nMy 2nd night they conveniently found me a room facing the opposite way as Fremont Street.  At night it was peaceful, quiet, and the way it should be.  \\n\\nThanks for comping me one night, though. It was my company's money and at least Orion admitted that my guest experience was not acceptable.  I told him to pass on to Brett that the Golden Nugget should start giving a disclaimer to all guests to warn them about the excessive noise that comes through the wall.  He said that it was \\\"a great idea\\\" and I'm sure that he was lying.  I bet he never brought it up again.  The fact is that the Golden Nugget is just not a guest friendly hotel at this time.  Maybe a change in staff attitude would help put the bow on an otherwise pretty package."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Very Bad"}]}

I love sitting at the sushi bar, enjoying some good food and conversation.  So, when my friend suggested that we go to Pure I was looking forward to trying this new-to-me sushi spot.  What can go wrong?  A lot.\\n\\nUpon arrival we were seated at the sushi bar, and immediately noticed that a boy around the age of 10 was seated alone next to us.  I wondered where his parents were (this was at night, and I thought it was strange to leave a child alone where liquor was being served), but really didn't think it would be an issue.  Mistake.  It quickly became obvious that he could not be unsupervised.  Disruptive.  Food everywhere.  Impossible to ignore.  I am not exaggerating.  Ick.  This is not McDonalds - where are his parents!?  My friend mentions this to our waitress not once, but twice.  This is when I expect one of two things to occur:   1) we would be offered different seating, or 2) a manager would ask the parents (who I realized were dining separately at the complete other end of the sushi bar - WTF?) to bring him to sit with them so as not to disturb others.  Neither of these things happened. \\n\\nIn the meantime, we have a pear martini (excellent), yellowtail sashimi (OK, not great) and attempted to enjoy a crabcake (blegh).  It was not fresh at all.  It tasted metallic.  Inedible.  I know what crab should taste like, and this isn't it.  \\n\\nBack to our young diner - my friend, realizing that this kid is a nightmare, approaches the parents to explain the situation.  Why did he have to do this?  Because nobody on the Pure staff would step up to deal with it.  At this point I am very irritated (and hungry!).  Oh, it gets better.  My exasperation is interpreted by my friend as annoyance or maybe embarrassment that he spoke with the kid's parents.  No, no, no.  I cannot explain this for some reason and now everyone is aggravated.  Oh joy.  The waitress chooses this moment to offer to bring us something else to replace the crabcake, but I was pretty much over the whole experience at that point.  Scary kid, creepy food, my friend is annoyed with me and I really just want to leave.  I cannot get my credit card out quickly enough.  Get me out of here - that year-old hot pocket that is lingering somewhere in the back of my freezer is sounding pretty good right now.\\n\\nOur waitress was extremely apologetic, and didn't charge me which I thought was nice (thus additional star).

I've been wanting to check out the Eureka Casino anyway....one of those solidly un-pretentious little locals' dumps that will doubtlessly be imploded any day now. Well, after having checked it out...IMPLODE AWAY, I SAY!\\n\\nEverything in this restaurant is coated in/soaked in/bathed in/wallowing in grease. My friend and I shared the pot stickers as an appetizer -- they were OK, although also glistening with gratuitous grease. As far as pot stickers go...they were like any other potstickers. Except greasier. All the better to slide down your gullet, I guess.\\n\\nNext, I had the much-ballyhooed Short Ribs Grilled Cheese. BLEECCCHHHHH doesn't even begin to describe this monstrosity! I thought the pot stickers were greasy -- this beast was OFF THE CHAIN GREASY! It was like eating a heavily-salted Jheri curl sandwich!! I don't like wasting food, so I managed to choke down half of it before giving up -- but it was G.R.O.S.S. It was SO salty it was almost like they were trying to cover something up. Also, the grease had a weird sort of stale aftertaste, like they use the same fry oil over and over. YUCK! \\n\\nThe fries that accompanied the sandwich were similarly greasy. I know, I know, French fries are called FRIES because they are FRIED -- but these were ridiculous. I've had better fries in the employee dining room at Caesars Palace! The fry grease had the same gross aftertaste as the sandwich, which totally killed whatever was left of my appetite.\\n\\nNow, you might chalk all of this up to my being a veggie-eating commie bastard -- but guess what? My friend, who is most definitely NOT a veggie-eating commie, had the Fat Choy burger...and was similarly grossed out. He reported that it, too, was astonishingly greasy -- although he did finish the whole thing, so it couldn't have been THAT bad.\\n\\nYou might blame me for not having ordered something less greasy than a grilled cheese -- but the menu is extremely limited here (one page only), and since I don't like duck or pork, I didn't want to get the highly-touted bao or any of the rice dishes. I'm willing to bet they are just as greasy, anyway :-/ In fact, there wasn't much of anything on the menu that grew out of the ground -- it was all lard, grease, carbs and meat.\\n\\nWhat really sucks is, I came in here fully expecting to adore the place -- being as it's located in such a solidly unpretentious dive. Speaking of which.....\\n\\nAfter I gave up on eating, and had sopped the grease off my face with no fewer than thirty napkins, I went out into the casino to have a drink at the bar, thinking I could salvage the evening with a little people-watching and a rum & coke to cut through the grease still coating my tongue. But even that went sadly awry.\\n\\nFirst of all, it's a cash-only bar, and I didn't have any on me. So I had to get raped by the corner ATM, and pay a $5 surcharge...which brought the cost of my drink up to Strip prices anyway. If I'm paying Strip prices, dammit, I want to at least be able to ogle drunk bitches with fake tits, etc. But all I got was a depressing, smoke-filled room full of methheads, with Kenny Loggins playing somewhere in the background. That kind of ambiance is OK if you're in a certain mood....\\n\\n...but when you're already on the verge of vomiting, it ain't no fun! I finished my drink and got the fuck out of there, probably never to return. \\n\\nI never thought I'd say this, but...there are some places that DESERVE to be imploded. You hear that, Tony Hsieh?!!

The mattress was a bit too firm and the blanket was pretty cheap.  They need an upgrade there.  The tv was a flat screen, but it was on the smaller side for the size of the room.  I did like that the bathroom i had didn't have a useless bathtub and instead had a walk in shower.  There was also complimentary Wi-Fi that worked well.\\n\\nThey also have breakfast in the morning.  Standard fare for these hotels.  They had nasty bacon however.  I love bacon and the bacon they had wasn't worth touching.

But today when I came in I was very disappointed. When I received my #9 I had ask the nice guy at the counter for 4 out of the hundereds that were in the giant box of packets of yellow mustard. He said he was only able to give me 2, 2 packets of yellow mustard for the giant sandwich I had in front of me was a joke. He said he would have to charge me 25 cents for a 5 cent packet of mustard. Thats like going to Mcdonalds and ordering 2 large frys and getting two packets of ketchup to fulfill your needs. When I asked Derek why would he have to charge a absurd price he stated \\\"Because Jimmy doesnt want you to ruin your sandwich\\\". Iam from the greatest country on Earth the United States of America,If I want to I should have the right to put what ever I please on a sandwich. I understand that Derek was doing his job and doing what he was told, so I asked for the \\\"head\\\" manager he directed me to Maranda(mustard natzi) a short overweight bitter woman, you could tell she was picked on in school by the look on her face and it was her mission to get back at the world.

She would not give me the time of day, all she said was \\\"company policey\\\" then  continued to do what ever it was she was doing. This is not right.

We had scheduled a team-building group event at the US National White Water Center and so I searched for hotels around that area. When I saw this hotel featured as an airport hotel I figured it would be in a safe enough location with some close-by eateries and quick highway access, etc...\\n\\nWe booked a total of 13 rooms with them and checked in individually. I had been in contact with one of their hotel managers. I was a little dissatisfied in how poorly I welcomed to the hotel. \\n\\nThe front desk clerk seemed \\\"oh-so enthused\\\" to be working that night, and when I let her know that I had been in contact with the manager and just wanted to make sure everything was in good standing, she went in the back, he was there, and never even came out to greet me.\\n\\nNow I didn't expect any VIP treatment. But usually when you organize a group event at a hotel you are give a very warm welcome. I know this because this wasn't a first for me.\\n\\nI had requested a room with a crib (only two months in advance, with a reminder the day prior), and when I requested one that night, yes the same clerk, took over an hour to get it. At first I wasn't even sure if she was going to because she never did give any indication she was paying attention to me at all.\\n\\nThe cable and internet did not work our first night there. No apologies were issued.\\n\\nThe room had a musty smell to it. I have a family of five (2 adults, 2 kids, and one baby) but they only had 3 towel sets in the room...even the next day after housekeeping came.\\n\\nThe hotel was not in the best of locations, it was secluded and not close to anything, and price-wise you could find better closer to downtown. I am not from Charlotte, NC and had only been there once...and again I figured \\\"airport\\\".\\n\\nThe hotel interior was nice and they did have a complimentary hot breakfast from served until 0930 am (another fact of information I had to PRY out of the front desk clerk). \\n\\nThe staff working the morning shift were much more pleasant and inviting. \\n\\nThe hotel was very quiet at night which we appreciated. The doors did not slam, thank God, as our baby girl is a very light sleeper. The hotel itself is clean and kept nice. It was not superior by any means but very nice for the average express.\\n\\nI rated poor because of the customer service but overall I would give it a three (average). However, I would not book here again not mainly due to my experience but due to the location. There are better hotels averaging the same distance from the USNWC but in better areas.\\n\\nIf anyone from management every reads this, please take a look into \\\"Deborah\\\" the front desk jerk...I mean clerk.\\n\\nStayed July 2011, traveled on business"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Bad"}]}

The casino is big and cavernous not appealing at all, it is trying to hard to be Los Angeles,and if you have read some of my other reviews, I hate Los Angeles, I hate even more when Las Vegas doesn't feel it has its own identity and style and feels that it has to steal from Los Angeles. Next it is designed like an MC Escher drawing, to get to the convention center you have to up then down then up again, simply shameful. Every other hotel casino on the Las Vegas strip you can walk by with no or very lute incursion, at City Center you have to walk up and down and be taken off the strip. Lastly my take is that they could not care less about Las Vegas community, they never created the jobs they said they would, and they do very little in the way of outreach, nor do they bring in the $$$$ they claimed they would. There are better places to go that are designed more intuitively and are more appreciative of your business.

That was our thing - taking a Sunday drive and stopping by RSC on our way back home to grab food and a piece of  \\\"Penny's Pies\\\".   Penny was the gal that used to make all the pies in Black Canyon City.  I learned while we were waiting for our table that there are new owners, and oh my how things have changed.  From the appearance and layout to more importantly - the quality of the food.   \\n\\nKeep on drivin' if you're hungry and in this neck of the woods.  J, Baby C, and I stopped by Rock Springs to get an early supper on Sunday after a day trip up north.  I told him about how good the pies were and the food was in general.  He was on board when it came time to figure out what we were doing for supper.   \\n\\nJ ordered the meatloaf dinner and I ordered the chicken.  Our plan was to feed Baby C off of both our plates.  Good idea in theory.  When we ordered, I stated I wanted a baked potato (which was on the menu) and the gal said that they don't serve baked potatoes until after 5pm.  Ummm...Its Sunday and a holiday weekend.  If one was going to sell a baked potato, 4pm on a Sunday would be the right time.  No where on the menu did it state that baked potatoes weren't available until after 5pm.  \\n\\nJ gets the soup (chowder) and I get a side salad.  You really cant screw up either of those.  J said his soup was pretty good.  \\n\\nOur dinner comes out a few minutes later.  We were shocked to say the least.  We both dig in and J immediately is repulsed.  His meatloaf was lukewarm, greasy, and the gravy on top was congealed.  GAG.  My chicken was more like a Cornish game hen.  See photo for the worlds smallest chicken leg.  It looked more like a drumette, you know, the kind you'd get with an order of chicken wings.  The vegetables that came with out dinners, a half ear of waterlogged field corn.  An ear of corn (a bad ear at that) hardly constitutes as \\\"vegetables\\\".  I was thinking we'd get green beans, peas, carrots, or something.  \\n\\nThe waitress came by and saw J was not pleased.  So she took his plate and asked if he wanted anything else. I told him to skip the regular food and to just get a piece of pie.  If he was hungry, we could get him something at the outlets in Anthem (which was where we were stopping by on our way home).  J liked this idea and ordered a slice of banana cream pie.  \\n\\nWhen the pie came out, he took a few bites and that was it.  He said it tasted like imitation banana and was not cold, but slightly warm.  I seriously doubt this was a true \\\"Penny's Pie\\\".  More like a bad knockoff.    \\n\\nThe only positive thing out of the whole trip was the waitress took his dinner and pie off our bill, without us having to ask or talk to a manager.  \\n\\nWe stopped by the general store, but the guy there didn't seem interested in helping us.  Or at least helping me.  But yet he yacked it up with J for a minute.  When I walked over to the counter to try a sample he was pushing J, did he acknowledge me?  Nope.  So we left.\\n\\nAnd we wont be returning.  If we're out for a drive, and are in need of food...we'll drive to Anthem.  \\n\\nAnd - If you really want a GOOD (more like AWESOME) piece of homemade pie, go to The Pie Hole in Phoenix.  :)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Very Bad"}]}

Any VIP table inside the club has decent view of dancefloor and traffic flow is great to fish for hotties walking by.  Tables outside arent optimal for tailchasing and are cheaper than inside of course.  However, if you get a daybed by the pool it is romantic spot for your date or fling for the night.

A few flat screens hang from the ceiling.\\n\\nThe facility itself is very clean and well maintained. Even though the equipment might not be the newest it looks pretty current, and nothing was broken or out of service. The locker room is pretty sweet. Really nice facilities with hot tubs, saunas, couches, flat screen tv, coffee, and fruit. Early in the morning there are not that many people up at that time so I basically had the gym to myself.\\n\\nThe hours of the gym are 6am - 6pm, so it's good for an early morning workout but I wished it stayed open later for those of us who are working a long show at the convention center and would like to get in a workout when returning back to the hotel. Also, you can buy a daily pass or a three day pass for $51 which includes unlimited access and use of the spa. If staying more than a few days it's worth it to get a multiple day pass to bring the rate down.

(i could see since her since her office has a window) I have also called on many occasions during business hours for work orders and no one ever answered the phone for a few hours.\\n\\n3. the apartments: had a bug issue upon moving in. flies and gnats everywhere. my neighbor had told me upon her moving in, her refrigerator was infested with dead cockroaches. the apartment was not cleaned (mold ring in the toilet) and numerous inconsistencies within the infrastructure, such as holes to nowhere under the sink and in certain areas of the floor boards when they connect to a wall or cabinet.\\n\\n4. work orders or issues with living conditions: water was shut off for multiple days without warning or notice. i, nor did most of my connecting neighbors, have hot water for over 48 hours, MULTIPLE TIMES.\\nI called one sunday because my front door would no longer lock (the door was splitting in half) the serviceman complained about having to leave his home on a sunday to fix my broken front door. he didnt fix anything but tighten the screws of the deadlock. i explained to him ive done this numerous times but the door continues to loose grip of the lock since it is splitting down the middle, he refused it was an issue with the door and refused my request to replace the door altogether, rendering the safety of my apartment completely unimportant.\\n\\nAll other complaints I have about this apartment complex is minuscule compared to the ones listed above. \\nSTAY AWAY."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Very Bad"}]}

They don't have a lot of beer on tap.\\n\\nThe other time there, it happened to be a night where they had the grill going, on Mondays I believe.   Me and two friends each had a dinner platter of various steaks with sides.  The meat was tasty and well done, though not spectacular.

But despite the non-greasy they were fairly fantastic.\\n\\nYou can ask for a side of their house BBQ sauce.  Not bad flavor, but it is a mainly straight black pepper taste; not quite a true thicker multi-flavored typical BBQ.\\n\\nEverything tasted great, everyone was happy.

People were not exactly lined up there but just sitting around talking.  There was no organization at all..just by memory and the honor system.  I thought it might cause problems but I went with the flow.  That was a big mistake.  For some reason, there was a couple who many parties accepted to cut in front even though we got there before them (which the couple admitted to).

Plus regular pools and hot tubs near your rooms.\\n\\nThe bad\\nThey are trying to save money in every direction, which makes it all seem very thrifty in a luxury setting.\\n- Lots of signs and Chatter about buying a timeshare\\n- They closed the lobby sundry store before 7:00 pm!!!

I don't need the free valet - its a 10' walk, nor the USA today delivered, nor a one way shuttle to the mall.\\n\\nThe ugly\\nI was smoking mad about the lobby store closing before the posted time. My plan had been to stop in after our dinner (we dined in their lobby restaurant) and pick up some breakfast items, plus some wine. Instead we paid $30 for a bottle of wine at the restaurant, and $50 for breakfast room delivery. And on that, it was late, and several items were missing. We had an early appointment, and couldn't use the lobby restaurant. Total bust.\\n\\nWhen I called the lobby reception to ask about it, they couldn't have cared less. They said \\\"well yeah, they leave if it's dead\\\".\\n\\nThe cost of keeping an employee in there is $15.00 an hour. They would have sold 100.00 based on myself, and the 2 other couples that we're not sure why it was closed. Sadly, this just points to a very inexperienced manager in the economics area. Basically, 1 customer an hour will break it even.\\n\\nWould I stay here again? Yes. The Rooms are great. But it's just not a high end experience.

No we are not, but thanks for asking...The drinks took ten minutes to come out, apparently we should have said we were in a hurry. \\n\\nFor the starters I got the Beef Tenderloin Carpaccio for myself and Shrimp Cocktail for my wife and her mom, both came out fast and were decent taste wise overall. The waitress to me seemed a little spacy and not quite there, we had numerous other waiters/waitresses stop by in between for refills and checking up on us since she wasn't.\\n\\nFor entrees we all ordered the Cider Brined \\\"Double Cut\\\" Pork Chops, wait times were roughly 25-30mins. We were anxious to eat it as they were very thick chops, until my wife cut her pork chop open. The center of it was medium rare, borderline rare. Mine was a tad undercooked and also her moms, the waitress even commented and took it all back. They recooked it correctly and ten minutes later we received it back, the meal was above average and we enjoyed it.\\n\\nNow I normally would let this slip, but the manager proceeded to stop by our table and explain that is how they cook them at Silvercreek and well sorry. I guess the waitress isn't aware of this because she was the one to first point it out. If this is the case, it should be stated on the menu, totally unacceptable and unprofessional behavior as it wasn't really a legitimate apology. The manager there needs etiquette training, you do not act snooty like that to customers.\\n\\nThe desert we decided on was Caramel creme burlee and I have to say it was perfect. It made up a little bit for the disappointing experience, but hardly a reason to return only for that.\\n\\nOverall my experience was mostly negative with the service and how things operate there, they try to come off as upper scale but it falls flat. The location they are located it is a little bizarre, as right next door you have some sort of vehicle repair shop and things look a bit run down.

I have no idea why this place gets so many good reviews but I guess with Vegas being a big tourist area most people reviewing this place have no clue what good sushi tastes like...especially a reviewer that states there is no place better in California!!? I live in Southern Cal and some of the best sushi I've had has been in the LA area i.e. Sasabune, Mori etc. But I'll simplify to specifics:\\n\\nService:\\nSucks...lots of staff running around serving people with way too much money and food takes forever.  \\n\\nSushi:\\nWe tried the bigeye tuna pizza and I guess it was decent...nothing to call home about. As for the sushi...I never knew they could cut sushi so thin and charge so much money.  I don't mind spending money on sushi but throw me a bone and at least make it hearty!? I can't believe they call themselves a sushi joint. I guess Bellagio can get away with charging that much for people that don't want to leave the hotel. The rolls were tiny and mediocre tasting. Usually my wife and I are fighting for the last piece but at Yellowtail we were fine leaving the overpriced food.\\n\\nAmbiance:\\nI kept reading about being sat by the fountains which is why I chose the place. But the first thing you see on the site \\\"patio seating is very limited and you are not guaranteed a spot\\\" Well figures...when we walked in it was packed and we got seated in the middle area which basically defeated the whole purpose of us eating there. It's basically a club that serves sushi.\\n\\nSummary:\\nA white washed sushi joint for people with too much money.  Lesson learned...Vegas is not the place for sushi...should have listened to the other reviewers. I wish I would have spend my time and money at a restuarant like Joel Rubichon or Bouchons or even just the buffet.  Won't go back. I spent $190 for an appetizer 2 drinks, a couple rolls and a couple pieces of mediocre sushi.

The bread was delicious, it's lead me to one of those moments where I said \\\"I could just come here for the bread\\\" and this was no lie. All of that was delicious. We were discretely told about the menu and placed our orders, which came out warm and fresh right away.\\n\\nI ordered the Beef Wellington, the house special on Sunday and my girlfriend ordered the Steak Bordelaise.

Nothing personal against this particular franchise...my beef is with Bikram yoga in general. Doing a Bikram class feels like working out at the Jonestown Athletic Club!\\n\\nBikram devotees strike me as slightly brainwashed in their adherence to the cult of Bikram. This is reinforced at the end of every class, when everyone utters a monotone \\\"Namaste\\\" in unison, while laying flat on the floor with heels touching and palms out. Heaven's Gate, anyone? \\n \\nAnother thing I found creepy is that the instructors are required to recite pretty much word-for-word from a script. Funny quips and jokes are more robotic, less funny when you've heard them over and over (\\\"Japanese ham sandwich\\\"). They also have to repeat Bikram's mangled English (\\\"Put your exactly forehead to your knee\\\"). Exactly forehead? WTF is that?\\n \\nI'm not blaming the instructors -- it's Bikram himself (Bikram Choudhury, who devised this regimen in the early '70s) who insists that all his franchisees follow his shtick TO THE LETTER if they want to keep teaching. Yes that's right -- FRANCHISEES; it's a freakin' FRANCHISE that will set you back $10,000 and then $1,000 a month. That's in addition to the $10,500 fee for taking the required instructors' course. Think of all the Bikram studios across the U.S. The humble yogi is raking it in!\\n \\nWell, at least he's honest about it. Direct quote from Bikram: \\\"Bikram yoga is so big. This is a bathroom slipper you buy (for) $2 in Kmart. But you put Bikram on it, it'll sell for $35 in a second.\\\" I'll give him props for his balls. Oh, speaking of his balls, here's another direct quote: \\\"I'm beyond Superman. I have balls like atom bombs, two of them, 100 megatons each. Nobody fucks with me.\\\"\\n \\nIndeed, back in 2000 he sued a couple of yoga techers in CA for teaching a modified version of Bikram (they had the audacity to add music and lower the thermostat in the room from the sacrosanct 105 degrees, 40% humidity). The case was settled out of court.\\n \\nIn addition to these ethical quibbles, I'm not so sure about the health benefits of doing a strenuous workout in a 105-degree room. They say I will sweat out all the \\\"toxins\\\" in my system. As far as I know, sweat is just salt and water. I didn't see any booze, shrooms or trans fats rolling down my face.\\n \\nI was going to finish my 30-day trial membership at Bikram Yoga Summerlin, just to give it a fair shake. Maybe I'd end up getting over my reservations, lose 10 pounds, become more grounded, and be able to sleep well again....??? \\n \\nThen I came to my senses and went back to Las Vegas Athletic Club... which costs me $9/month and offers a variety of un-copyrighted, unpretentious yoga classes.

The QUINOA of the day was described as red quinoa, mango, mint, red onion, and some other delicious sounding ingredients. It was fresh and cold, but not at all delicious.

FOUR CHANCES, and they blew every single one.\\n\\nVisit #1: I go with a handful of girlfriends. Order a margarita. Worst margarita of my life, hands down. My friend also ordered one and hated it. We both had to send it back (the first and only time I have ever sent a drink back. It was that bad). We told our server that we'd like something different, but we needed a moment to decide. She rolled her eyes, took them away, and we didn't see her until much later, when she delivered our bill. I had no drinks that night.\\n\\nVisit #2: I went with my husband for lunch. Ordered the crab sandwich. I took a bite and it was an effort to swallow it, it was so disgusting. Now, I used to live off of eating out just about every day of the week. My husband and I are always incredibly polite to our servers and feign enjoying meals that are sub par. Getting meals you don't like is a part of life. This, however, was inedible. For the second time ever (I never send food back, I know how annoying it is for the servers and feel so bad), I had to send it back and ask for something different. Our server seemed really perturbed, but did bring me the meal I ordered instead. It was mediocre at best, but I ate it without any complaint. I apologized profusely to our server and assured her that I liked the new meal, even though I didn't, in hopes of her mood improving. It didn't.\\n\\nVisit #3: Don't even ask me why, but my husband and I were craving Oysters and thought that we'd give Casey Moore's Oyster House another chance to impress us. Not only were the oysters not good (we did not complain about them this time, though), but our server was so rude that we thought we had wronged her in some way. Dirty looks, only stopped by twice I believe in the hour and a half we were there, didn't say hello or smile once. We thought maybe we had caught her on a bad day, but the joyful smile on her face as she laughed with the table of men directly across from us quickly made us realize that this was not the case. To be clear, we did not complain about anything at any time. We were kind, polite, and didn't keep her from other tables. What the hell?\\n\\nVisit #4 (tonight): I went with a girlfriend for drinks after a run. I only went because it was a beautiful night and I wanted to sit outdoors. First off, we had my friend's dog with us and went to the front without the dog to see if we could tie him up outside of the establishment (around a tree). Nobody was there so we went back to get the dog to tie him up (again, outside of the place, by the sidewalk). A man promptly and rudely said, \\\"I'm not letting you two in with that dog out there.\\\" Okay. So we took the dog back to the car and left the window down for him. When we got back and found a seat, I smiled and said hello to our server when he greeted us. Upon asking us what we wanted to drink, I said, \\\"There is a drink at Boulder's (bar down the street) I really like and was wondering if you guys might do something similar...\\\" \\\"We don't.\\\" He said, and just looked at us. That's it. I proceeded to tell him what the drink was (Strongbow mixed with a Raspberry type beer). \\\"No, I told you we don't.\\\" Finally after awkwardly floundering about, my friend and I settled on another drink. We did get what we ordered and it was good (we both got Strongbows with a shot of Fireball). But seriously, dealing with TWO rude men tonight, plus the history I've had there, makes me realize I really will never go back ever. And I mean it this time.\\n\\nI mean truly, I am extremely polite and go above and beyond to make people feel comfortable and happy to be serving me. I smile big, say hello, don't take too much of their time, don't whine or complain, etc. But the fact that four of my all time worst restaurant experiences were all from Casey Moore's is just too much to ignore.

But, an appetizer does not a meal make so lets go on to the main course and side dish. \\n\\nFor lunch I had some sort of pasta which was advertised to have anchovies, lemon, and if i remember correctly, hot pepper. I also ordered a side of braised greens. The pasta, when it was served, came in a large white bowl and honestly, when I order a pasta dish over $10, I prefer it to be well...plated, on a plate. The dish also contained sauteed fennel which, while not unpleasant, was not expected, and it seemed, it was a bit dry. As for the braised greens, also served in a large white bowl and that was it, just the braised greens. Some cracked black pepper and some shaving of hard cheese, would definitely have helped round out the side dish (though at $3 I can't complain too much but make it $4 and bump it up a bit). \\n\\nFinally, the decor, nothing really stands out. Sen, right next door, has much more of an artistic edge so maybe they could kick up the look of the place a bit.

One thing people talked about was the unique entranceway into the restaurant, designed to emulate the Chunnel from France into England.  It was interesting but best to appreciate it before you walk in since before the hostess can even finish telling you what the entrance represents, you are already through it and into the bar area.  The bar is separated from the two storied restaurant by a glass wall.  The ground floor eating area is adjacent to an open kitchen which allows the smell of the cooking steaks to permeate the restaurant.  There is a long flight of stairs against one wall leading to a second eating area on the balcony overlooking the restaurant.  After you sit down and take in the surroundings, you being to realize just how loud and blaring the background music is.  You can hardly hear the waiter not to mention the people sitting across the table from you.  I guess the overly loud music is supposed to give an energy to the place but it is too overdone and passes well into the annoying range.\\n\\nWe started with a half dozen west coast oysters ($20) and a heirloom tomato salad ($18). The oysters were very fresh and come with a trio of sauces: vinaigrette, soy sauce and a traditional red cocktail sauce.  The tomato salad was a medley of sweet tomatoes, prosciutto and watercress.  Both simply presented dishes were very well done.  \\n\\nFor the second course, we had the asparagus soup ($17) and lobster bisque ($26).  The asparagus soup was served over a central mound of Dungeness crab, celery and smoked salmon caviar.  The soup had a rich asparagus flavor and the subtle crab meat blended well with it.  However, when you were unfortunate enough to bite into one of the cheap orange caviar pearls, the taste was ruined but this intense fishy flavor filling your mouth.  I do like unique combinations of flavor but these tastes did not mesh well at all.  The lobster bisque was served with a whole portion of shelled lobster tail meat sitting in a very flavorful brown lobster broth.  The meat was buttery and perfectly cooked. Clearly, this was a well thought out dish and earned the high recommendation the waiter gave it when suggesting entrees.\\n\\nFor dinner, we had the roasted Beef Wellington (one of Gordon's signature dishes at $52) and the fish and chips ($42).  The Wellington was served already sliced down the middle on a layer of very creamy mashed potatoes.  There were puddles of a dark brown, very salty demi-glace splashed around the dish and a small pile of glazed root vegetables.  Overall, the dish was good however not one to order if you like your meat well done.  As it is, I like my meat medium rare so the very pink interior didn't bother me.  The fish and chips however were a greasy mess.  The fish filets are served breaded and fried with their tails on.  The two filets are plated on top of several large dollops of tarter sauce.  The dish comes with a small side of truffle oil fries.  The first thing you notice however is the somewhat unappetizing fishy smell.  I'm sure the fish was fresh (it better be for $42) so perhaps they are reusing the oil to fry batch after batch.  I suppose it is somewhat ironic to complain that a fish dish smelled fishy but it was unappetizing to have your food smell like an old fisherman's net.  When you cut into the fish, the next thing you notice is the oil pouring out around your knife and fork.  Combined with the creamy tarter sauce, this is a heavy, heavy greasy dish.  It tastes all-right but it will sit on your belly for the rest of the night.  If you have plans later, it is probably best to avoid this particular entree.\\n\\nFor desert, we had the sticky toffee pudding ($13), a small French pressed coffee ($8) and a double espresso ($8).  The pudding is served along side of a small cup filled with extra molten toffee to pour over the pudding and a rectangular block of butter flavored ice cream, made to look like a stick of butter.  Unfortunately, there was so much butter in the ice cream, it also tasted like a cold stick of butter.  The pudding was very sweet, almost too sweet, such that after a few bites, you feel like you need an injection of insulin.  The whole dish is gaudy, in-your-face butter and sugar.  We stopped eating it after a few bites.\\n\\nThe waiter did a good job and came by often during the meal.  However, you can only hear half of what they are saying to you due to the excessively loud music. It was amusing to look around and see different waiters around the restaurant leaning in to repeat things to other diners.  Doesn't the manager also notice things like this? Overall, the food was ok but was certainly not worth the excessive price tag.  You are basically paying extra for the name and hoping the food lives up to the reputation.  Unfortunately, the entire experience falls short."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mediocre"}]}

It is built into the side of a mountain so the parking spaces and rooms are very far away and a long walk (up hill) from all the pools and restaurants.  Parking is another issue all together.  We never had an issue (thankfully) but the parking by the actual rooms was scarce and the main parking is quite far from the rooms if you were unfortunate enough to not find a space.  Also, the bar in the adult pool wasn't open at night which was highly inconvenient and we ended up going to a bar off site.\\n\\nThe Pros... the place is gorgeous.  The rooms are top notch, the sheets and bed were super comfortable and we were very well rested by the end of our stay.  The pools are very well maintained and there are a bunch of them.  The room service was delicious and the onsite dining at Pointe in Tyme was amazing as well.\\n\\nAlso, we had arrived with the expectation that free wifi would not be available, but it turns out it is included in the $10/night resort fee we were charged so that was a pleasant surprise.\\n\\nI would 100% return in the future!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good"}]}

Of course, the main draw to this show is the music of the Beatles.  Most of the tracks are taken directly from the Beatles' albums and played as a backdrop to a Cirque du Soleil show that was less Cirque, and more of a visualization of the Beatles' style, cultural impact, and art.  There are roughly four performers who serve as caricatures of the Beatles, and it was evident that several sequences mirrored the lives of the Fab Four.\\n\\nA lot of the acts did more to tell a story rather than showcase a skill, which I thought kept the show together as one coherent piece.  And although I'm not big fan, some of the interpretive dance sequences were truly memorable.  The 360 degree stage was also interesting, and while it seemed during some scenes a little too big for what was going on on stage, most of the audience a central view of the action.  The wide movie theater style screens behind the back rows added visualization effects and depth.\\n\\nOn the way out, I noticed several people exiting the theater still singing Beatles tunes.
